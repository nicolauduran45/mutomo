# mutomo 🥤🤖

## Description
**mutomo** aims to build an open dataset for multidimensional key information extraction from scientific abstracts, and to fine-tune a small, local language model for structured, abstractive extraction tasks.

## Objectives
* Create a high-quality, annotated dataset covering research motivations, objectives, methods, impacts, and topics.
* Design an annotation workflow and task definition using Argilla.
* Fine-tune and evaluate a small, open-source LLM for efficient, on-premise extraction.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

### ⚙️ Environment
To use conda for full reproducibility:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --name topic-labelling
conda activate topic-labelling
```

To update/export your environment:

```bash
conda env export --name topic-labelling > environment.yml
```
