  "title": "INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AND METHOD TO INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OF A LIQUID IN THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE",
  "abstract": "A method, controller, and internal combustion engine including the controller and operable in accordance with the method by: determining a temperature of a working liquid in an engine block circuit (31, 35) of the internal combustion engine (10), the working liquid comprising a cooling liquid or a lubrication liquid; operating the internal combustion engine (10); engaging a thermal load responsive to the temperature of the liquid being below a first temperature threshold, wherein engaging the thermal load comprises at least one of increasing a pumping load of the internal combustion engine (10), or changing an air/fuel ratio, thereby adding heat to the engine block circuit (31, 35); controlling the thermal load as a function of the temperature of the liquid; and disengaging at least a portion of the thermal load responsive to the temperature of the liquid being above the low temperature limit.",
