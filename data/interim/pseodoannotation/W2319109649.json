  "abstract": "I WISH to comment on the results of the 2014 badger cull, especially the results for Gloucestershire. Having spent a few nights out with the cull contractors I am very well aware that, as stated by Defra, anti-cull activist activity was one factor resulting in reduced numbers removed, but colleagues ought to be aware of other potential factors. The badgers cannot be removed unless they are present and, as discussed below, one of the big problems in the current debate is that no-one can be sure of the initial numbers present. As one would expect, if a significant proportion of the badger population is removed in year 1 of the cull, then there will be fewer to be removed in the second year. This would appear to be the case for â€¦",
