  "title": "A REFINING MEMBER AND HUB WITH SPLINES WITH A WEAR INDICATOR",
  "abstract": "A hub and a member, the member having a central opening. The hub is received in the member central opening. The hub has a center, and a hub axis through the center. The hub also has a splined exterior with a plurality of splines, each spline having a spline surface, and the member central opening has internal splines that engage with the hub splined exterior. At least one of the hub splines has a wear indicator, the wear indicator comprising a surface mark that extends along a portion of the spline surface in the same direction as the hub axis.",
