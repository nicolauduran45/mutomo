  "title": "A CLAMP",
  "abstract": "A clamp having two clamping portions, each arranged to hold an item in a fixed location relative to the item held by the other clamping portion. The clamping portions are joined by a connection means having a joint, the joint permitting the connection means to move between at least two configurations. In this way the clamping portions can be fixed in parallel, perpendicular or other desired angular orientation. It is envisaged the clamp will be used for locating two pipes in relative positions whilst being joined by means such as welding.",
