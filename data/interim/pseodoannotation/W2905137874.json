  "title": "Design of RLWE Cryptoprocessor Based on Vector-Instruction Extension with RISC-V Architecture",
  "abstract": "A ring learning with errors(RLWE) cryptoprocessor based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture is proposed in this work. The cryptoprocessor is the integration of RISC-V core and co-processor. The co-processor is designed to complete complex polynomial operation such as addition, subtraction and multiplication. And RISC-V core is responsible for sending simple signals to control the operation of co-processor. To support parallel data processing and increase the bandwidth of accessing memory, this work extends vector channels and uses vector paths in internal data bus to transfer data. Besides, Operands adopt a memory-memory approach to reduce the latency of accessing data. The polynomial multiplication chooses the algorithm based on number theoretic transform(NTT). In the cryptosystem, arithmetic operations are performed on the NTT domain, which avoids the frequent operations of conversion to the finite-loop domain. And polynomial processing unit adopts the architecture of 8-lanes commutator to improve the degree of data parallelism. Barrett algorithm is chosen as module reduction operation in finite-loop domain. Simulation results show that RLWE cryptoprocessor operates properly and requires 60.5/22.0us to complete encryption/decryption. Results depict time-taken in encryption and decryption are both reduced comparing to designs based on FPGA Virtrex.",
