  "title": "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RUNNING TWO TUBING STRINGS INTO A WELL",
  "abstract": "A well has a vertical casing (13) with a window (14), and a lateral wellbore which communicates with the window, and which may have a casing (18) or liner. A window assembly (31) aligned with the window (14) has respective passageways for first (51) and second (52) tubing strings, and has a concave surface (36) for deflecting the first tubing string out into the lateral wellbore. The passageway for the second tubing string has a portion which is inclined at a very small angle with respect to a vertical centerline of the vertical casing. As the first tubing string is run into the vertical casing, a rotational locator (126) is releasably coupled thereto by a soft release coupling mechanism (176). After the locator effects rotational orientation, the coupling mechanism (176) is released and then permits the first tubing string (51) to move therepast without damage. A seal assembly (56) on the first tubing string (51) is covered by a protective sleeve (147) as it is inserted into the well, and exits the protective sleeve (147) after entering the lateral wellbore.",
