  "title": "On the energy integral formulation of gravitational potential differences from satellite-to-satellite tracking",
  "abstract": "Two approaches have been formulated to compute the gravitational potential difference using low–low satellite-to-satellite tracking data based on energy integral: one in the geocentric inertial reference system, and the other in the terrestrial reference system. The focus of this work is on the approach in the geocentric inertial reference system, where a potential rotation term appears in addition to the potential term. In former formulations, the contribution of the time-variable components of the gravitational potential to the potential term was included, but their contribution to the potential rotation term was neglected. In this work, an improvement to the former formulations is made by reformulating the potential rotation term to include the contribution of the time-variable components of the gravitational potential. A simulation shows that our more accurate formulation of the potential rotation term is necessary to achieve the accuracy for recovering the temporal variation of the Earth’s gravity field, such as for use to the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment GRACE observation data based on this approach.",
