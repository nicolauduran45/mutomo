  "abstract": "Abstract The main purpose of the paper is to develop a neural network application that could predict supplier problems in terms of stock management, lead time and production. Stocks of goods that manufacturers would classify as raw materials stocks are, in a special sense, goods in early stages of the production process. In a logic-based economic competitiveness, the company which holds the largest stock is underperforming! Technically, the stock is inevitable and in some cases even desirable; economically it is associate with an asset value stock, therefore, it should be minimized. Minimizing the value, the costs will also be minimized.",
