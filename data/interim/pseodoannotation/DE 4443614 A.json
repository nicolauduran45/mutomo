  "abstract": "The backrest (2) of the vehicle seat has a through opening (11) which is released by the swivelled out seat surface (4) of the child seat (3). The opening can be covered by a flap (14) attached to the vehicle seat backrest and designed to swivel out towards the back. The seat surface (4) and backrest (5) of the child seat (3) lie flat against each other in the backrest face (6) of the vehicle seat backrest (2). The child seat backrest can be locked at different angles to the its seat.",
