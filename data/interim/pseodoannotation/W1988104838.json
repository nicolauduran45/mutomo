  "title": "Adaptive protection and microgrid control design for Hailuoto Island",
  "abstract": "Summary form only given. Microgrids can provide various economic and environmental benefits but their implementation poses great technical challenges in control, protection and energy management. One of the most important technical aspects in microgrids is distribution system protection. This paper first demonstrates a need for and then focuses on the design aspects of the adaptive protection system addressing issues such as: selection of alternative setting groups, components and system architecture; system configuration and programmed logic. The system is based on a centralized controller running the real-time analysis of the data received from the field Intelligent Electronic Devices and communicating with them by means of IEC 61850 communications. The adaptive protection and microgrid control system has been developed and currently being installed at Hailuoto island in Finland.",
