  "title": "A lower bound on the value of entangled binary games",
  "abstract": "A two-player one-round binary game consists of two cooperative players who each replies by one bit to a message that he receives privately; they win the game if both questions and answers satisfy some predetermined property. A game is called entangled if the players are allowed to share a priori entanglement. It is well-known that the maximum winning probability (value) of entangled XOR-games (binary games in which the predetermined property depends only on the XOR of the two output bits) can be computed by a semidefinite program. In this paper we extend this result in the following sense; if a binary game is uniform, meaning that in an optimal strategy the marginal distributions of the output of each player are uniform, then its entangled value can be efficiently computed by a semidefinite program. We also introduce a lower bound on the entangled value of a general two-player one-round game; this bound depends on the size of the output set of each player and can be computed by a semidefinite program. In particular, we show that if the game is binary, $\\omega_q$ is its entangled value, and $\\omega_{sdp}$ is the optimum value of the corresponding semidefinite program, then $0.68\\,\\omega_{sdp} &lt; \\omega_q \\leq \\omega_{sdp}$.",
