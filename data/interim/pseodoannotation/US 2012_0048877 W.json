  "title": "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PERFORMING WELLBORE FRACTURE OPERATIONS",
  "abstract": "Methods for performing oilfield operations are provided. The methods involve performing a fracture operation. The fracture operation involves generating fractures and a fracture network about the wellbore. The fracture network includes a plurality of fractures and a plurality of matrix blocks positioned thereabout. The fractures are intersecting and hydraulically connected. The matrix blocks are positioned about the plurality of fractures. The method also involves generating flow rate through the fracture network, generating a fluid distribution based on the fracture network, and performing a production operation comprising generating a production rate from the fluid distribution.",
