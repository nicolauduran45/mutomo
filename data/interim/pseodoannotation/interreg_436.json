  "title": "PIANO STRATEGICO PER LO SVILUPPO DELLA RETE CICLOTURISTICA TRANSFRONTALIERA NELL’AREA INTERREG IIIIA DELLA REGIONE LOMBARDIA E DELLA SVIZZERA - TERRITORI DI VARESE, COMO, LECCO E SONDRIO",
  "abstract": "“Bike Network - Piano strategico per lo sviluppo della rete cicloturistica transfrontaliera” punta alla costituzione di una rete ciclabile transfrontaliera italo-svizzera, che comprenda le principali zone di interesse turistico dei laghi Maggiore, Ceresio e Lario, e si integri ai sistemi ciclabili della provincia di Sondrio e delle valli di collegamento con i Cantoni Ticino e Grigioni. L’obiettivo principale del progetto e quello di valorizzare le risorse territoriali e il patrimonio locale della fascia trasfrontaliera italo-svizzera sia attraverso l’integrazione di progetti di valorizzazione gia promossi o programmati, sia attraverso l’individuazione delle componenti naturalistiche, culturali e sportive dell’area, favorendo in tal senso una nuova interpretazione del territorio in chiave turisticoculturale. Inoltre si mira a favorire l’uscita dalla marginalita delle comunita transfrontaliere, incentivando nuove forme di collaborazione e l’attivazione di partenariati per la condivisione di progetti di sviluppo interregionali, rafforzando cosi l’identita culturale del territorio e la sua comunicazione verso l’esterno. In questo contesto l’individuazione di percorsi ciclabili di collegamento transfrontaliero ed interprovinciale, e la definizione di itinerari ciclo-pedonali che valorizzino gli aspetti turistico-culturali delle Province e Regioni coinvolte nel progetto, rappresentano uno strumento fondamentale sia per rafforzare l’identita locale, sia per valorizzare e dare unitarieta alle numerose progettualita a favore della mobilita lenta e del turismo sostenibile. Contestualmente all’identificazione del network di percorsi ciclabili individuati dal progetto, verranno promosse opportune politiche a sostegno dell’intermodalita su ferro, gomma e acqua, al fine di garantire all’utenza ciclo-pedonale e turistica una mobilita totale nell’area e una migliore accessibilita e raggiungibilita delle risorse territoriali.",
