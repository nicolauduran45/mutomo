  "abstract": "The CHANNEL proposal brings together world-leading and highly experienced industrial and research partners with AEM electrolyser expertise to address the topic New Anion Exchange electrolyser - FCH-02-4-2019. The main objective of CHANNEL is to develop a low cost and efficient electrolyser stack and balance of plant (BoP) that will become a game-changer for the electrolyser industry. The concept is to construct an AEM electrolyser unite using low cost materials, using state-of-the-art anion exchange membranes and ionomers, non-PGM electrocatalysts, as well as low-cost porous transport layers, current collectors and bi-polar plates. This will enable the development of an electrolyser technology at a capital cost (CAPEX) equal or below classical alkaline electrolysis. However, in contrast to the alkaline technology, the CHANNEL AEM electrolyser will have an efficiency and current density operation close to the one of proton exchange membrane electrolyser (PEMWE). The CHANNEL stack will not only result in decreased electrolyser part count, but it will also be able to operate at differential pressure, as well as under dynamic operation, optimal for producing high quality, low cost hydrogen from renewable energy sources.",
