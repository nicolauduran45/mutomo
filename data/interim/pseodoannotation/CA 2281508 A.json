  "abstract": "There is provided an absorbent material for personal care products which is made from wettable fibers of at most 40 microns in diameter which are made into a web and where the web has controlled spaces in the side away from a wearer point unbonded bonding pattern. The web will accept a liquid insult of 50 ml with a runover/run-through percentage ratio of less than 1.5. Such a web material may be used in personal care products like diapers, training pants, absorbent underpants, adult incontinence products and feminine hygiene products. Especially of interest are diapers having a narrow crotch, i.e., those having a crotch width of at most 7.6 cm.",
