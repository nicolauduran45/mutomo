  "title": "Enhancing research and innovation capacity of tubitak mrc food institute on dietary polyphenols and bioavailability/ bioefficacy",
  "abstract": "The main objective of the PhenolAcTwin project is to enhance the scientific and technological capacity of TUBITAK MRC Food Institute (FI) and to raise the research profile of the Institute and its staff in the field of dietary polyphenols and bioavailability/bioefficacy via networking with three leading European institutions such as CSIC, QIB, and INRAE. FI is a leading research center in the area of functional foods/nutraceuticals in Turkey. Our networking and collaboration with global leaders in this research field will help us in developing an European-wide known center with increasing research and innovation contributions and achievements on dietary polyphenols and bioavailability/bioefficacy. Such achievements will increase the participation of FI in European and international projects and promote higher performance of other research institutions in Turkey. The partners from research-intensive institutions have high international reputation and expertise in the various aspects of polyphenols, bioavailability, and bioefficacy as well as omics. Additional advantage for the FI is that the leading research partners have complementary competences ranging from various fields: identification of dietary polyphenols, in-vivo, in-vitro analysis, and human clinical trials. Based on the expertise and achievements of FI, PhenolAcTwin will contribute to “Vision Document” of Joint Programming Initiative (JPI): “A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life” and 11th Development Plan of Turkey with relevant thematic priorities. The work program of the project is distributed in six work packages including the main activities, envisaged in the work programme of the Call. PhenolAcTwin project gives specific importance on improving the research profile of human resources especially the young researchers by enhancing the research and innovation capacity and networking, as well as improving proposal preparation and project management/administration skills.",
