  "title": "Digital Content Rendering that Supports Alpha Is Shape (AIS) as part of Knockout Groups",
  "abstract": "Digital content rendering techniques are described that support Alpha Is Shape (AIS) as part of a knockout group. In order to support AIS rendering of an object within a knockout group, an alpha-separated color value is generated by removing an effect of an alpha value of an object of a knockout group on a pixel. A color-blended color value is then generated by the GPU based on the alpha-separated color value and a color value associated with a backdrop of the knockout group for the pixel. A determination is also made as to an amount of spatial coverage for the pixel by comparing the object to the pixel. From this, a rendering color value is generated by the GPU based on the color-blended color value, the alpha value, and the amount of spatial coverage of the pixel by the object.",
