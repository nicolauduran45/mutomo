  "title": "Agent-Based Privacy Aware Feedback System",
  "abstract": "In the field of information technology, a feedback system is a computer program that receives information from the users and guides the target audiences in order to achieve the desired outcomes. The Feedback systems can be used as a part of an intervention in organizations to increase awareness and improve performance. However, due to many factors such as possibility of losing jobs and facing social problems, people of the organizations are not interested to disclose their identities while providing feedbacks about their organizations. This is the most significant problem of current feedback systems. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a framework to provide feedbacks without disclosing individuals’ record’s values. In our approach, we introduce an agent-based parallel computation technique that can collect feedbacks from the users in a secure environment. We provide an extensive experimental evaluation to show the effectiveness of our approach.KeywordsFeedback systemsprivacy aware systemsagent-based computation",
