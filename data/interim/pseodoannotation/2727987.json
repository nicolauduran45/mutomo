  "abstract": "The transition towards a low-carbon economy is significantly transforming the power system from a unidirectional, centralised and fossil-based system towards a bidirectional, distributed and renewable-based one. In this context, DSOs and TSOs are facing more complex grid operations, including challenges like reverse power flows, additional power flows in transmission systems and grid stability issues. Available tools for grid management in this changing environment have often underperformed for several reasons (e.g. unavailability of grid models, data management restrictions, use of conventional approaches to the application algorithms, etc.).  INTERPRETER will overcome limitations of existing tools through a modular grid management solution consisting of a set of 10 software applications for an optimal design, planning, operation and maintenance of the electricity grid – with a special focus on the distribution network – that will be offered to grid operators through an open-source interoperable platform. These tools will support DSOs and TSOs to move from a traditional grid management approach to an active system management approach, considering the rapid deployment of distributed energy resources as well as growing environmental concerns.  INTERPRETER activities will be conducted by a strong and well-balanced consortium composed by 5 RTOs, 2 DSOs, 1 SW developer company leader in its sector and 1 SME specialised in communication & dissemination. The project includes an ambitious validation phase, in which the solutions will be tested in 3 pilots in Belgium, Denmark and Spain, thus ensuring a high replicability across Europe. Overall, the project aims to achieve an annual economic impact in the project pilots from investment deferrals of 36.6 M€ due to the remuneration of assets and of 28.15 M€ due to the amortisation of the capacity assets, as well as a recovery of 665,576 € from non-technical losses detection and 11,422 € from reduced outage frequency.",
