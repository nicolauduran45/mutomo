  "title": "Noise-reduction device for automobile air-conditioning circuit, conduit and circuit comprising same",
  "abstract": "The conduit has a noise reducer device (607) in its internal space and mounted to contact a wall of the conduit. The device has geometry of a tubular part delimited by two transversal inlet and outlet faces (608, 609) for fluid and by an external radial face (610) which connects the inlet and outlet faces. The inlet and outlet faces form an axial channel (612) for passage of fluid in the device. The external face is partly cylindrical and matches with the conduit wall. Ratio of a minimal passage section of the channel and a transversal section of the external face is between 0.05 and 0.75.",
