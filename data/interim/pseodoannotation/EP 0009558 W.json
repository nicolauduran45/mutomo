  "title": "BIODEGRADABLE EXCIPIENT SYSTEMS FOR THERAPEUTICALLY ACTIVE SUBSTANCES AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME",
  "abstract": "The invention relates to a formulation for a sustained-release biodegradable medicament that contains an excipient system. Said excipient system consists of biodegradable blood plasma products that have been dried in a fluidized bed while maintaining their properties and an active substance to be applied as a sustained-release substance or a combination of active substances.",
