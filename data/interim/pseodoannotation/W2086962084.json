  "abstract": "본 연구는 일제강점기의 우리나라 철도와 만주철도를 비교하였다. 양국철도는 공히 제국주의 철도라는 공통점을 가지고 있었지만 서로 다른 성격을 가지고 있었다. 첫째 만주철도는 정부주도하의 민간철도라는 성격을 가지고 있었다. 우리나라 철도는 철도수입위주였지만 만주철도는 철도이외에도 지역개발, 광산, 항만 운영 등 다양한 사업을 전개하였다. 두 번째 만주철도는 우리나라 철도에 비해 수익성이 좋았고, 화물위주의 수송이었다. 세 번째로 철도관료의 경우도 우리나라는 주로 정부 관료들이 임명되었지만 만주철도의 경우는 정당정치에 의한 정치가, 외교관 등 다양한 계층에서 임명되었다. 관동군으로 편입된 이후에는 군의 영향력이 컸다. 공통점으로는 제국주의 철도였기 때문에 정부정책 특히 시기적으로 철도는 군사적 목적에 활용되었다. 특히 만주철도의 경우 대륙에서의 전쟁수행이라는 면에서 직접적인 영향을 받았다고 할 수 있다. 향후 같은 시기의 일본 본토 그리고 대만과의 비교연구를 통해 동아시아 철도의 공통점과 차이점의 부각을 통해 우리나라 철도의 성격이 새롭게 조명될 수 있을 것으로 기대된다. This paper presents a comparison of Korean and Manchurian railway system during the Japanese colonial era of Korea. While both railways share the common characteristics of an imperial railway, they revealed several differences. Firstly, the Manchurian railway was likely a private company, although it was operated half privately and half by the government. The Manchurian railway operated like the East Indian Company in India during the English colonial era. On the other hand, the Korean railway was fully operated by the government at a ministry level. While the Korean railway solely concentrated on the railway, the Manchurian railway was involved in regional development and the coal-mining industry as well. Secondly, in contrast to the Korean railway, the Manchurian railway was more lucrative, and was relatively more predominant regarding carriage of freights. Thirdly, railway officers in Korea were elected government bureaucrats, while Manchurian railway officers came from diverse political parties and social strata. After the annexation by the Kwantung Army, the Manchurian railway was mainly influenced by the military. The common characteristic here was that both railways were utilized for military purposes as imperial railways. In partilcular, the Manchurian railway executed military orders directly. Hereafter, through a comparative study between the Japanese and Taiwanese railways, a clear and accurate understanding of the characteristics of the Korean railway during the Japanese era will be revealed.",
