  "abstract": "Propolis is a mixture produced by bees (Apis mellifera L.) from various plant sources with a diverse chemical composition including many bioactive phenolic compounds and terpenes characteristic of plant secondary metabolism. The bees use propolis mainly as a sealant for cracks in the beehive, but it has been used in human folk medicine for several millennia. A renewed interest in its study emerged in recent years due to the increasing popularity of natural products in foods, beverages and medicines. Propolis extracts have been associated with varied biological activities, like antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory among others, and indicated for the treatment of several pathologies such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. Portuguese propolis, usually regarded as a by-product without any value in apiaries, remains insufficiently studied, hence the need for a better characterization of its properties. In this study Portuguese propolis samples from different apiaries and different collection dates were selected and ethanolic and n-hexane extracts were prepared and tested using a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in vitro flax (Linum usitatissimum) cultures as models. Viability assays with yeast cells and plant growth analysis were performed to assess extracts toxicity. The yeast model was used to investigate mechanisms of cytotoxicity by the mitochondrial membrane potential-targeting fluorochrome rhodamine 123 approach and to evaluate genotoxicity by the comet assay. The in vitro plant model was used to evaluate extracts effects at the multicellular developmental level as well as in the photosynthetic function by pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry. Both photoinhibitiory and photoprotective potential against oxidative damage of the extracts were investigated using plants grown under high light intensities. Extracts antioxidant properties were also studied in yeast by flow cytometry using the redox-sensitive fluorochrome dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Our results suggest that ethanolic extracts from Pereiro and Povoa do Varzim apiaries are among the most toxic for both yeast and plants. They decrease yeast viability and mitochondrial membrane potential and dramatically affect early plant development inhibiting particularly root growth, photosynthetic efficiency and increasing nonphotochemical quenching in a dose-dependent manner. Significant genotoxicity was found only in ethanolic extracts from Pereiro collected in 2010, also one of the most toxic in both models tested. However, some ethanolic extracts were also able to revert oxidative-induced damage. They reduced intracellular oxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide in yeast, and greatly recovered the total chlorophyll content reduced by high-light-induced photooxidative stress. Here, also n-hexane extracts were effective. Globally our results are in line with the antioxidant properties revealed by propolis worldwide but also underline the strong toxicity in different cellular models suggesting that eukaryotic universalâ€¦",
