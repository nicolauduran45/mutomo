  "title": "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DIAGNOSING KIDNEY CANCER",
  "abstract": "Systems, methods, and computer readable media for diagnosing or characterizing kidney cancer based on serum amino acid profiles are provided. Serum amino acid concentrations, and optionally also serum creatinine concentration, are determined in serum obtained from a subject and compared against reference concentration profiles. The condition or prognosis of the subject may be determined based on comparisons of patient samples with reference profiles.",
