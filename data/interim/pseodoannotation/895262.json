  "abstract": "By the year 2050, the global population is set to touch 9.6 billion; one major challenge the world is going to face is feeding it’s population. Add to it the many challenges that plague the farming industry such as the change in climatic conditions, extreme weather conditions and impact on the environment, which have to be overcome in order to meet the demand for more food. Farmers deal on a daily basics with huge amounts of data which they have to interpret and act in accordance. The Nexlys Lda’s Augmented Reality Assisted Farmer's Intelligence Toolkit(FIT) is a system designed to support the farmers in their daily operations. FIT aims to take the interaction between the farmers, their plantation fields and the deployed technological resources to a new level. It will deliver intelligence data via an Augmented Reality(AR) display and will allow farmers to interact with operational assets. FIT will provide better, more streamlined crop management; maximize existing investments; reduce operation and management costs; reduce losses; improve profitability and working conditions. FIT’s target customers are all farmers and farmer’s organizations.. The objectives of this feasibility assessment are to define market niches, consumer needs, evaluate relevant legislation and ethical aspects, identify and solve market barriers, determine the FIT’s technical feasibility, as well the economic and social impact of it’s commercialization. Within 5 years, the FIT’s commercialization will create a return on investment of 207%, grow the company sustainability and create the conditions to hire 60+ staff. Most importantly it will contribute as an answer to the European Union(EU)’s sustainable development Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.",
