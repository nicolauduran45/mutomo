  "title": "Robott-Net - a shared infrastructure to sustainably optimise technology transfer throughout europe",
  "abstract": "The main objective of the TT-Net initiative is to create a sustainable European infrastructure to support novel robotic technologies on their path to market. TT-Net will develop and test mechanisms for sharing expertise and physical research infrastructures, and a unique multidisciplinary approach that enhances cross-fertilisation of ideas between academia and industry. We transform successful national structures and mechanisms used by Research and Technology Organisations (RTOs) in Denmark, Germany, Spain and the UK; merging them into a Europe-wide, composite, technology transfer system.  Together we will test and improve a four-stage process to accelerate the path to market for new robotic technologies. The first stage involves promoting state-of-the-art industrial and professional service robot technologies to over 1,200 end-users and robot developers (from industry and academia) in a bidirectional exchange of views and opinions about robotic research trends, needs and technology developments, and soliciting participation in TT-Net. The second stage involves technical and business feasibility studies for both end-users and robot developers at about TRL 5. The third stage implements first field trials at TRL 6 for a novel technology and then produces complete TRL 7+ robotic automation solutions at end-user sites. The fourth stage is the completion to TRL 9, facilitated within TT-Net but happening outside project control.  Accelerating the path to market of new robot technologies will increase Europeâ€™s market share in both industrial and professional service robotics. Installing European-standard robotic automation at end-user sites instead of the present national-standard automation will contribute substantially to increasing the competitiveness of Europe's manufacturing sector and in particular SMEs.",
