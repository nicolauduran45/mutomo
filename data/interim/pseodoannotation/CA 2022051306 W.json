  "title": "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR SEMI-SUPERVISED VIDEO-DRIVEN FACIAL ANIMATION TRANSFER",
  "abstract": "A method transfers facial expressions from a performance input to a 3D CG character. The method comprises: providing an inference engine trained for receiving, as input, images exhibiting facial expressions and outputting, for each input image, a 3D CG representation of a CG character having a character facial expression corresponding to that of the input image; receiving performance input, the performance input comprising, or convertible to, one or more performance input images, each of the one or more performance input images exhibiting a performance facial expression; and inputting the performance input images to the inference engine to thereby infer, for each of performance input image, a corresponding 3D CG representation of an output CG character having an inferred character facial expression corresponding to the performance facial expression of the performance input image.",
