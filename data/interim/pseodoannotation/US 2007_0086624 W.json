  "title": "MULTI-CHAMBERED FUEL ENRICHMENT DEVICE",
  "abstract": "A fuel enrichment device includes a body forming a first fuel chamber and a second fuel chamber. The second fuel chamber is adapted to contain a predetermined amount of enriching fuel to be provided to an engine. A normally open valve connects the first fuel chamber to the second fuel chamber. A normally closed valve for controls the provision of enriching fuel to the engine. The normally closed valve is open whenever the normally open valve is closed.",
