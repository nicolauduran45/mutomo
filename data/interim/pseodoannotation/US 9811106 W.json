  "abstract": "In one embodiment, an imager (201) has an array of photodetectors, each of which accumulates charge during an integration period as a result of light detected during the integration period, the array having a charge capacity which increases during the integration period. A charge capacity controller (202) coupled to the imager (201) adjusts how the imager (201) increases the charge capacity of the array based upon the brightness distribution detected by the imager (201) during at least one previous integration period.",
