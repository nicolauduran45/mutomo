  "title": "Aborto en México: estrategias discursivas en seis textos monológicos digitales de la iglesia católica, frente a los derechos de las mujeres a decidir sobre la interrupción legal de su embarazo",
  "abstract": "Con base en el esquema ideológico propuesto por Teun Van Dijk, se analizan seis textos discursivos de tipo monológico, que se oponen al aborto y que fueron publicados por el semanario católico: Desde la Fe, durante el año 2019. Se concluye que las estrategias monológicas discursivas de los seis textos analizados, han contribuido, como parte del poder del Estado Vaticano, a que se impida que las mujeres latinoamericanas decidan libremente sobre el destino de sus cuerpos, así como de su salud sexual y reproductiva. El artículo incentiva a que los poderes legislativos asuman una posición frontalmente laica en torno a la Interrupción Legal del Embarazo (ILE), por el bien de la salud y la libertad de las mujeres del mundo.",
