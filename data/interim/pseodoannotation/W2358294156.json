  "abstract": "The cultivated land requisition-compensation balance was an important method to guarantee the quantity and quality of cultivated land.Taking Liaoning province as an example,based on many problems such asoccupying better and supplementing bad,occupying more and supplementing less of cultivated land,the research put forward that the cultivated land gradation conversion in the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance should be carried out based on the cultivated land gradation results,on the conversion results basis,the evaluation index system of the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance was established referring to the LESA system,which would provide scientific test criterion for the projection implementation effect of the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance.",
