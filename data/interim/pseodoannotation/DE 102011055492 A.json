  "title": "Sliding rail arrangement for door drive, has sliding rail lever having lever portions that are displaced against each other for lengthwise adjustment of sliding rail lever by pressurization of hydraulic piston in hydraulic cylinder",
  "abstract": "The sliding rail arrangement (1) comprises a sliding rail (2) and a length adjustable sliding rail lever (3). One end of the sliding rail lever is connected with a driven shaft (4) of a door drive while other end is guided in the sliding rail. Two lever portions (6,7) of the sliding rail lever are provided with a hydraulic cylinder (8) and a hydraulic piston (11). The lever portions are displaced against each other for the lengthwise adjustment of the sliding rail lever by pressurization of the hydraulic piston in the hydraulic cylinder.",
