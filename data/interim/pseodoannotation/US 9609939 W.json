  "title": "DECORATIVE SURFACE COVERINGS AND METHODS FOR MAKING SAME",
  "abstract": "Decorative surface coverings comprise a multicolored, fused plastisol layer (25) comprising: (a) a fused plastisol composition of a first color (30); and (b) a fused plastisol composition of a second color (35), the second plastisol being distributed within the first colored plastisol such that the multicolored plastisol layer exhibits color gradients between the first (30) and second colored plastisols (35). According to certain aspects of the invention, the decorative surface covering products comprise a patterned solid plastisol mixture having a three-dimensional appearance. Methods for manufacturing such decorative surface coverings comprise the steps of (a) applying to a substrate (20) a coating of the first colored fluid plastisol (30); (b) distributing in the first colored fluid plastisol (30) a second colored fluid plastisol (35) to form a patterned plastisol mixture; and (c) forming the patterned fluid plastisol mixture into a patterned solid plastisol mixture (25).",
