  "title": "Entre centre-ville et banlieue : faire la navette à travers des récits audio-visuels ultra-contemporains",
  "abstract": "La banlieue constitue, aussi bien par sa conception politique que par sa considération et sa configuration sociale, un espace privilégié pour aborder l’évolution de la question identitaire en France au XXIe siècle. Prenant les films Le brio (2017), Les misérables (2019) et la série Marseille (2016) comme point de départ, on verra comment la fiction contemporaine illustre les tensions entre deux mondes – dominant et dominé –, et on analysera la force de l’empreinte dominante dans ces productions audio-visuelles. À travers le regard des personnages-navette –ceux qui traversent constamment la frontière invisible dedans-dehors–, les espaces de la banlieue et du centre-ville se rapprochent l’un de l’autre plus qu’on ne le croirait. Ce constat nous amènera à explorer la pertinence de certains lieux communs qui leur sont apposés.",
