  "abstract": "CONSIDER aims to develop sustainable management model (SMM) for industrial heritage sites (IHS) for the benefits of the local communities as a resource for strengthening collective identities, improving the urban landscape, promoting eco-friendly solutions, and contributing to the urban economy and a sustainablefuture of the city. It will investigate SMM for industrial heritage while exploring participatory governance models as a tool to better integrate IHS with European society. Deindustrialisation processes all around Europe give rise to social, economic and environmental problems that are resulting from structural change. Thus, there is an urgent need to find SMM to overcome these challenges. 3 research objectives are; i) To expand on what is considered as industrial heritage, how to safeguard them ii) To investigate the history of sites to identify most influential factors used to maximise the benefit iii) To explore inclusive governance and participatory models as a tool to better integrate industrial heritage with society. The innovative side of this model is its inclusive approach to the problem (regionally, sectorial, taking into consideration gender aspects, and its highlight on the exchange of knowledge, technology and labour). This novelcollaboration will be improved by through synergies, networking activities, organisation of workshop, summer school, webinars, and final conference to facilitate sharing of knowledge. The circular knowledge exchange is based on systematic and triple-helix approach between academia (universities), policymakers (municipalities), and practitioners (SME/NGO) that will contribute both in identifying problems and developing guidelines for their improvement. This research brings novelty in respect of geographic regions that previously were not sufficiently investigated and inventoried thus providing the basis for further comparative research undertakings and sustainability of the project outcomes in creation of new knowledge.",
