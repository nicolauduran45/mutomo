For such functions and their Pade–Chebyshev approximations $ \\pi_{n,m}^{ch}\\left( {x;{f_{\\gamma }}} \\right) $ , we find the asymptotics of decreasing the difference $ {f_{\\gamma }}(x) - \\pi_{n,m}^{ch}\\left( {x;{f_{\\gamma }}} \\right) $ in the case where 0 ⩽ m ⩽ m(n), m(n) = o (n), as n→∞ for all x ∈ [−1, 1]. Particularly, we determine that, under the same assumption, the Pade–Chebyshev approximations converge to f γ uniformly on the segment [−1, 1] with the asymptotically best rate.",
