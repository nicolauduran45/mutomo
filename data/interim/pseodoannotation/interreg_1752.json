  "abstract": "In the past years, Countries have understood the importance to bet on innovative entrepreneurship, promoting the launch of companies based on the research activities of youngs, researchers, startuppers. However, in the territories involved in this Programme, the lack of funding and networking opportunities are hampering these enterprises to grow. Moreover, research centers often do not know how to turn successful ideas into concrete products and services. This project aims at creating an innovative ecosystem, inter-linked with research and entrepreneurial actors in public-private logic, able to foster dialogue between different territories, enhance collaborative research actions, supporting talents mobility and strengthen the capacity of attracting private capitals. To realize this, it will implement the following main operative steps: Supporting the creation of an interregional network among the main stakeholders: research and technological centers, companies and public administrations; Defining a model for the technology centre, exportable in Albania and Montenegro and based on the Italian 20 years&#39; experience; Facilitating knowledge sharing & talents mobility. The Main outputs of the project will be: The Interregional Ecosystem, networking businesses, research centers, technological districts and Public Administrations, an international cluster for the promotion of Spin-offs, Start-ups, and innovative organizations operating, in the mid-long term, as an international Hub able to catalyze experiences, knowledge and expertise; the Albanian Technological Center, set in Tirana; International liveshows and workshops across project partners’ territories, to promote the project cluster, attract private investment funds, and look for new creative talents and potential innovative SMEs; continuous training Fund.",
