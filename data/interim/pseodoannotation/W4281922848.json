  "title": "Brazilian Organic Honey from Atlantic Rainforest Decreases Inflammatory Process in Mice",
  "abstract": "Honey is an ancient food in the human diet, and the chemical composition of some types of honey has been associated with several beneficial biological effects. Among them, honey has been highlighted to improve health and control inflammatory processes. However, there is no study elucidating the mechanism of action of honey produced organically. Here, we separated organic honey (OH) samples from the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest into eight different profiles (OH-1 to OH-8) and evaluated, in vitro and in vivo, their anti-inflammatory potential. To determine cell viability, RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with several concentrations of OH-1 up to OH-8, and anti-inflammatory activity was assessed through NF-κB activation and TNF-α levels. All types of the studied honey up to a concentration of 4% (w/v) did not interfere with macrophage viability and decreased NF-kB activation and TNF-α levels in macrophage culture in vitro. OH-7 was selected as the most promising anti-inflammatory and used in subsequent assays. Mice pretreated orally with OH-7 showed a decrease in neutrophil migration and TNF-α level. Thus, these types of Brazilian organic honey show promising anti-inflammatory potential, particularly the OH-7 variety. Brazilian organic honey may lead to the development of new products and/or be incorporated into food for use in veterinary medicine and human health as well.",
