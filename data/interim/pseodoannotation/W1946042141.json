  "abstract": "Based on the unique characteristic of high soil moisture in the flooding and transplanting period of rice, rice pixels in Jiangsu Province, China were extracted by vegetation index algorithm. The unique characteristic could be reflected by relationship between different vegetation indexes derived from MODIS09 data. Then, the relationship between statistical yield data and vegetation index of rice extracted previously in 2004-2006 was analyzed. Finally, rice yield in 2007 was predicted. The results showed that the method based on MODIS data can estimate yield effectively. The accuracy of predicted yield of each city in 2007 was about 95% and the relative error was 0.38% at the provincial level.",
