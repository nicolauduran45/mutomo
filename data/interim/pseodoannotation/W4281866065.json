  "title": "Inclusão digital nas cidades: Um olhar sobre os idosos",
  "abstract": "Cidades sempre serão espaços ricos para pesquisas, nelas podemos encontrar uma heterogeneidade de pessoas e possibilidades para serem exploradas. O objetivo do estudo foi investigar a inclusão digital dos idosos no espaço urbano a partir do uso de Smartphones ou celulares, para compreender como estes se inserem, se comunicam, aprendem e se desenvolvem. Optou-se por este público, levando em consideração que o envelhecimento populacional é um fenômeno que ocorre em escala global e vem gradativamente aumentando devido aos avanços tecnológicos em todos os âmbitos. Esta é uma pesquisa de método quantitativo realizada na cidade de Santa Cruz do Sul, interior do estado Rio Grande do Sul, com 100 participantes, todos com mais de sessenta anos. Primeiramente, apresenta-se alguns conceitos importantes sobre cidades, envelhecimento humano e tecnologias. Na segunda parte, a discussão é construída através da análise dos questionários aplicados em grupos de convivência do município.",
