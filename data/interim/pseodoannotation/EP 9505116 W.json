  "abstract": "The invention concerns alternating voltage plasma displays which, with the development of high-definition television, are becoming increasingly important. With such displays, it is already possible very satisfactorily to produce screens of optimal flatness and size. However, a drawback of known plasma displays is the fact that problems of brightness and luminosity arise at the required high definition. In the plasma display according to the invention, this problem is solved by an electrode structure which ensures significantly larger gas discharge regions by comparison with known electrode structures.",
