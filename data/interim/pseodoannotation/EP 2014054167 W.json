  "title": "METHOD FOR SUPPLYING A VEHICLE WITH ENERGY",
  "abstract": "The invention relates to a method for supplying a first vehicle with energy. In order to design the supplying of energy to the first vehicle by means of an assisting second vehicle in case of a shortage of energy for the first vehicle to be safer for both vehicles, with low expense, the invention proposes that a minimum energy requirement of the first vehicle is determined in advance, an energy reserve of the second vehicle is determined and thereafter said energy reserve is compared to the minimum energy requirement of the first vehicle, possibly taking into account any travel paths deviating from the originally planned route in the course of the assistance. The invention further relates to a corresponding device.",
