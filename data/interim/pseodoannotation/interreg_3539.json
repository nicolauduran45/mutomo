  "title": "SportUrban - Sport et loisirs facteurs de cohésion sociale, de développement économique et de régénération urbaine",
  "abstract": "In view of the challenges of social exclusion and spatial segregation, SportUrban aims to answer the following questions: Can the integration of people and the reconstruction of social links be promoted by the ways in which sport and leisure activities are used? Can local economic development be based on the demand induced by the sports and leisure sector? Can urban renovation be furthered by policies for the creation or transformation of sporting facilities? Can the image of a district, town or complex be developed through territorial marketing based on promotion of sports and leisure policy? Overall objective / Objectif général The aims of SportUrban are to: • Organise the sharing of experiences in implementing local sports and leisure policies • Identify and test practices leading to the integration of economic, social and urban factors • Disseminate partners’ know-how and the most useful tools for decision-makers • Create awareness among political decision-makers and increase the professionalism of technical authorities responsible for groups • Return Europe to its territories and encourage people to adopt their European citizenship. Expected results / Résultats attendus The expected impact of the transfer of experiences and competencies will be improved practices and greater cultural and technical awareness of European experiences. The sharing of know-how should lead to a higher level of qualification among partners, modification of operating methods, adaptation of local policies and improved governance measured by response to social demands. In urban regeneration and economic development, SportUrban will be able to influence local policies by providing an outside view of local projects and revealing dimensions which are currently underestimated. This should enrich both regional and local policies. New skills and new vocational training may be created. New analytical tools should improve public policies. The project will pass on its results outside the EU.",
