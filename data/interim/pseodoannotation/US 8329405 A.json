  "title": "Bottle cap with combination lock",
  "abstract": "A locking cap for a container has a combination lock built into the top. Two or more thumbwheels with numbers or letters are mounted beneath the top surface of the cap or gung plugs. The thumb wheels have through holes corresponding to the numbers or letters. One or more pins are slidably mounted in the cap. The pins are locked by the thumb wheels unless the through holes are in alignment. The pins either project through holes in the container or abut inwardly, projecting portions with the top of the container to prevent turning of the cap unless the pins are retracted. Combinations of numbers or letters can be preset at manufacture, or selected at or after sale, using plugs to fill selected through holes.",
