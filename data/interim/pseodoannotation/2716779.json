  "abstract": "MTM S.r.l has developed a game-changing platform comprising 1) an algorithm able capture 2D images and convert them into 3D geometries ( we have already validated our solution on Cardiac Imaging), in order to generate hyper realistic ( more than 10X resolution respect of the best 3D medical imaging today present in the market) models/mockups, ready to be used in VR and 3D printing allowing an unprecedent medical training approach, as well as a simulation of real patients’ condition on which perform pre-operative simulation in healthcare environment; 2) a sophisticated software able to manage multiple actions: such as loading 2D image parts produced by medical scanning devices (organs and tissues), generating 3D models from 2D images elaborated by our algorithm, enable the user (thanks to our intuitive GUI – Graphical User Interface) to visualise the 3D model, (choosing from different views, differentiate surfaces, anatomical sections, layers, regions of interests), recognising anomalies, tagging the mutations and the morphology aberrations, supporting and collecting extensive libraries of 2D images and 3D models, enabling an unprecedent new way to train students and surgeons during critical preparation to surgery. ROG’s business model. We already mapped our value chain and plan each phase of our path to exploitation. Our revenue model will be a combination based on: ROG software platform licensing and sales from personalized processing of 3D image services (The specialized paid services will instead involve the personalized processing of 3D images, the tagging performed by semi-automated expert systems and the possibility of having training sessions on the platform).  As a result of the maturation strategy and the higher potential value of our system, we will see growth in revenues and profits that will enable us to increase our headcount to 12 by 2026 with a raw return on investment (RoI) of 2.29%.",
