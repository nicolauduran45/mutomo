  "title": "DISTANCE MEASURING DEVICE",
  "abstract": "The invention relates to a distance measuring device, in particular a hand-held laser distance meter, comprising a housing (12) and a transmission unit arranged in the housing (12) for transmitting a measuring radiation (18) in the direction of an object to be measured, a receiving unit for receiving measuring radiation (18) returning from the object to be measured, and a first operating element (20) for triggering at least one distance measurement. According to the invention, the first operating element (20) is designed in the form of a disk element. The invention further relates to a method for operating a distance measuring device, in particular for operating a hand-held laser distance meter, wherein at least one first distance measurement is started by means of a first operating element (20) provided on the housing (12) of the distance measuring device (10). The first operating element (20) is moved from a second position (B) in which the distance measuring device is deactivated into a first position (A), in particular along the measurement axis, in order to trigger a first distance measurement, in particular in order to trigger a sequence of distance measurements, in particular a sequence of continuous distance measurements.",
