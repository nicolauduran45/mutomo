  "abstract": "In the theoretical part, this Bachelor’s thesis on “On-line Television Broadcasting“ outlines the legal regulation of television broadcasting by definition in order to provide a better understanding of the issue, as it differs from the “on-demand audiovisual media services” both by law and in the ways of broadcasting, transmission and delivery of electronic data to public. The new regulation of on-demand audiovisual media services adopted in 2010 has been initiated by the Directive 2007/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007. It introduced certain changes in the field of broadcast regulation towards all providers of audiovisual media services, revising also the television broadcasting and on-demand audiovisual services. The amended regulation addresses not only the on-demand audiovisual media services, but also reforms radio and television broadcasting as such, mainly the Act No. 231/2006 Coll., as amended.",
