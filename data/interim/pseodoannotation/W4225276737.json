  "abstract": "<bold>Objetivo.</bold> Conocer la efectividad de la vacunación contra SARS-CoV-2 para prevenir el desarrollo de enfermedad y muerte por COVID-19 en Córdoba, Argentina, en el periodo enero-junio de 2021. <bold>Métodos.</bold> Se llevó a cabo un estudio de cohorte retrospectivo en 1 139 458 residentes en la provincia de Córdoba. Se construyeron modelos de regresión logística múltiple que relacionaron la vacunación con la infección por SARS-CoV-2 o la muerte por COVID-19, considerando comorbilidades y factores de riesgo de enfermedades crónicas y ajustando por sexo y edad. <bold>Resultados.</bold> El haber recibido una o dos dosis de vacuna en la población general redujo el riesgo de enfermar un 98,8% y 99,3%, respectivamente; y de morir un 83% y 96,5%, respectivamente. En quienes contrajeron COVID-19, la probabilidad de morir se redujo en 57% y 80%, respectivamente. En cuanto a la probabilidad de muerte, el riesgo aumentó a medida que aumentaba la edad y con la pertenencia al sexo masculino o la presencia de obesidad, hipertensión arterial o diabetes mellitus. <bold>Conclusión.</bold> La vacunación es efectiva y protege contra la posibilidad de contraer COVID-19, desarrollar enfermedad grave o morir. Presentar obesidad, hipertensión arterial o diabetes mellitus, en orden decreciente, aumentan el riesgo de morir.",
