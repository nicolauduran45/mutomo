  "title": "Front end conveyor having adjustable entrance support",
  "abstract": "A front end conveyor has an upstream end and a downstream end, a lower deck including a plurality of primary sheet supports and an upper deck including a plurality of sheet guides. Upper portions of the primary sheet supports lie in a first plane and the sheet supports and sheet guides define a sheet transport path for moving sheets in a sheet transport direction. A pivotable sheet support extends from an upstream end of the lower deck and has at least one surface lying in a second plane. The pivotable sheet support is pivotable from a first position in which the second plane forms a first angle with the first plane and a second position in which the second plane forms a second angle with the first plane, the second angle being different than the first angle.",
