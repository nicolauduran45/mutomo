  "title": "COOKING CONTROL DEVICE, COOKING CONTROL SYSTEM AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT",
  "abstract": "The present invention relates to a cooking control device that comprises sensors (120) and a communication unit (145) to communicate with a display processing device (170). In this manner, taste values of the cooking substance reflecting the current status of the cooking process can be compared with pre-stored taste values representative of a desired cooking result and seasoning advice according to a recipe can be established and presented to a user to converge the cooking status with the desired cooking result.",
