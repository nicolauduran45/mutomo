  "title": "Multiwalled carbon nanotubes/cryogel composite, a new sorbent for determination of trace polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",
  "abstract": "Abstract A new cost-effective sorbent, multiwalled carbon nanotubes/poly (vinyl alcohol) cryogel composite (MWCNTs/PVA), was prepared under frozen conditions for the extraction and preconcentration of trace polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water samples. This was followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The proposed method provided a high enrichment factor with an extremely high extraction efficiency (89–98%) of three spiked levels of three standard PAHs with relative standard deviations of less than 8%. The low detection limits of the method were 5, 8 and 5 ng L− 1 for benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene, respectively. This method was successfully applied for the determination of the three PAHs in real water samples where they were found in the range of 7 to 22 ng L− 1. The major advantages of MWCNTs/PVA over the commercial C18 is that it can be operated at a higher loading flow rate without sorbent clogging and requires a shorter time for completion without any loss of extraction efficiency.",
