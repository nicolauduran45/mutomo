  "abstract": "Techniques for operating a loom to produce multiple different textiles during a single operation of the loom. Conventionally, a loom produces a single textile during each single operation of the loom. When producing multiple different textiles during a single operation of the loom, a single run of the mill may generate the multiple different textiles for multiple different customers. In some embodiments, during a single operation of a loom, the loom may generate a single piece of loom-finished fabric that includes multiple different textiles for multiple different customers and, following the single run of the mill, the single piece of loom-finished fabric may be cut apart to yield the different textiles, which may be one, two, more than five, more than ten, or any suitable number of different textiles for any suitable number of different customers.",
