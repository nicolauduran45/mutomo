  "abstract": "As noted in the introduction, the European Environment Agency has defined ETR as ‘a reform of the national tax system where there is a shift of the burden of taxes from conventional taxes such as labour to environmentally damaging activities, such as resource use or pollution’ (EEA 2005, p. 84). ETR is therefore a particular kind of policy instrument, which seeks to apply revenue-raising economic instruments (which may be taxes or auctioned permits in an emissions trading scheme) to resource use and pollution, in order to increase the efficiency of resource use (resource productivity) and improve the environment, and reduce other taxes such that the policy is revenue neutral overall. ETR in this interpretation is therefore a tax shift, rather than a tax increase, whereby taxation is shifted from ‘goods’ such as labour (e.g. income taxes, social security contributions) or capital (e.g. corporation taxes) to ‘bads’ (pollution, resource depletion). As will be seen, ETR was implemented on a relatively small scale in a number of North European countries in the 1990s and early 2000s, with broadly positive results. ETR is hypothesised to increase human well-being through the economic and environmental pathways illustrated in Figure 6.1. This suggests that environmentally ETR will reduce pollution and resource use; economically it will increase output and employment directly, and stimulate green innovation that will do so further indirectly, as well as bringing about further environmental improvement. In themselves, both these economic and environmental impacts will increase human well-being; but the economic impact will be decoupled from environmental damage, so it is more likely to have a positive net impact on human well-being than much current economic growth. There are good theoretical reasons for supposing that ETR will have the effects shown in Figure 6.1. These have been briefly reviewed in the Introduction to this book, as well as being extensively covered in the environmental economics literature (see Ekins and Barker 2001 for a survey). Very briefly, because many environmental impacts are not priced, they do not enter into market decisions and they are therefore greater, and have a greater negative impact onhuman welfare, than is desirable. Environmental taxes give a price (explicitly or implicitly), or a cost, to these impacts, therefore encouraging their reduction, which increases human welfare. This is the rationale for supposing that ETR will lead to increased human welfare from environmental benefits. The environmental taxes also raise revenues which, for a given level of total tax revenue, allow other taxes to be reduced. Taxes on labour and profits are known to have disincentive effects and cause economic output to be lower than it would otherwise be. Reducing such taxes can therefore, other things being equal, increase output. However, increasing energy taxes, other things being equal, is likely to reduce output. The balance of these two effects (and a key strand of the academic literature explores how different kinds of taxes interact) will determine whether the tax shift will reduce or increase output overall. A further effect on output may come from the impact of the tax shift on employment. If employers’ labour taxes have been reduced as part of the tax shift (and this has often been the case where such shifts have been implemented), this may increase employers’ labour demand. If there is unemployment in the economy, this may lead to more people being employed who were formerly unemployed. This would result in an increase in output. Finally, the shift in the relative prices of carbon/energy and labour or profits will result in a shift in the relative benefits of labour-saving carbon/energysaving technical change. Because carbon/energy is made relatively more expensive, more technological and innovation effort is likely to be directed to using less of it, thereby raising its productivity. If this process reveals opportunities for carbon/energy saving that were cost effective even before the carbon/energy tax increase, or have become so (and there is substantial evidence of the existence of such opportunities, even in well run and profitable firms), or if it channels innovation into directions that enable other resource savings and product improvements, then the tax shift could also lead to increases in output and employment through this route (the middle pathway in Figure 6.1.",
