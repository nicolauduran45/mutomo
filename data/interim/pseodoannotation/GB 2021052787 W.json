  "title": "BREAST PUMP AND BREAST PUMP VALVE ASSEMBLY",
  "abstract": "The present invention relates to a breast pump, in particular a breast pump and a breast pump valve assembly each for use in providing negative pressure when expressing milk. A breast pump valve assembly comprises a suction chamber for fluid connection to a negative pressure source. A fluid chamber is defined between a first one-way valve and a second one-way valve, wherein the first one-way valve is configured to allow flow of fluid into the fluid chamber and the second one-way valve is configured to allow flow of fluid out of the fluid chamber. A displacement member fluidly separates the suction chamber and the fluid chamber and is configured such that application of negative pressure to the suction chamber causes movement of the displacement member to thereby increase the volume of the fluid chamber and draw fluid into the fluid chamber through the first one-way valve.",
