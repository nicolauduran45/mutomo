  "abstract": "A fuel tank for vehicles, especially for passenger motor vehicles, in which a container is provided on the inside of the tank within the highest area thereof and located at least partially above the maximum filling height; the container is closed except for at least one opening of small cross section located at its bottom side and is provided with a connection extending additionally to the tank by way of a dome mounted on the tank; the portion of the connection leading from the dome to the container is constituted by a channel with a channel opening on the side of the dome disposed near the apex of the dome; a vent and pressure-release line for the tank system which projects out of the dome in the upward direction protrudes into the channel under formation of an annular gap of relatively small cross section which permits the ready passage therethrough of gas but which permits the passage therethrough of fuel only in small droplets.",
