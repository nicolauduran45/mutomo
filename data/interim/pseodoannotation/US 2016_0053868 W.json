  "title": "FORMATION TESTER COMPRISING REACTIVE FILTER MATERIAL",
  "abstract": "The embodiments herein relate to formation testers having reactive filter materials for detecting analytes in subterranean formation operations. The formation include a body having an outlet, a probe extendable from the body and having a sealing pad and a probe snorkel tube, a flow line within the body, wherein the flow line has an entry end connectable to the probe snorkel tube and an exit end connectable to the outlet in the body, a sample chamber fluidically connectable to the flow line downstream of the entry end of the flow line, and a reactive filter material in the flow line downstream of the sample chamber. The reactive filter material sorbs an analyte in a wellbore fluid.",
