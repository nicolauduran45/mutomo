  "abstract": "Between Corsica and Sardinia, there are no regular maritime connections that allow to develop economic, cultural and cooperation relations with continuity and fair costs. The GEECCTT-Iles action project takes on this Programme challenge to optimise and enhance relations between the islands of the cooperation area by creating an inter-insular connection tool to meet the needs of Corsica, Sardinia and Elba, all historically linked. Through analysis, definition and constitution, GEECCTT creates an EGTC - European Territorial Cooperation Group, a legal EU entity for the shared management of cross-border transport services between the islands. The creation of the EGTC will define the conditions for the management of regular cross-border maritime links between the islands, as well as the legal and administrative procedures for resolving the implications of this management at the Member State and European Commission level. GEECCTT will thus create the conditions for the development of innovative sustainable services for cross-border mobility between the islands through port nodes, also by facilitating the conditions for integration with the multimodal transport system to improve connections with TEN-T networks. The result is the setting up of conditions to create and manage jointly the relationships between Corsica and Sardinia—linked to the TEN-T systems—with an innovative perspective of cross-border continuity. The general population, businesses (especially SMEs) and the island and cooperation area communities will benefit from the result of this link that completes the upper Tyrrhenian area.",
