  "abstract": "The present disclosure relates to flexible sheet-like materials for use in construction. In one aspect, there is provided a flexible sheet-like laminate comprised of at least a layer of a water vapour proof material and at least a layer of an acoustic dampening material, in which the layers are bonded together. Such a flexible sheet-like laminate would do away with the need for a liquid membrane, meaning waterproofing and acoustic dampening could be installed far quicker and easier than previously possible. In one form, the flexible sheet-like laminate further comprises at least a layer of a reinforcing material.",
