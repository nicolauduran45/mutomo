  "title": "Agricultural Waste valorization for a competitive and sustainable Regional Development",
  "abstract": "The project stems from the observation of the massive use of plastic materials in agriculture, whose disposal is a high cost for companies, besides being a serious environmental problem. The general aim of the project is, therefore, to enhance competitiveness for the agricultural companies by reducing the costs of collection and disposal of plastic wastes. The specific objectives are: - to introduce the use of technologies (web based GIS) - to promote the application of international standards in public policies and to develop common local plans and procedures - to test the procedures of collection through the implementation of a temporary pilot station of disposal, cleaning and re-use - to transfer to small agricultural businesses the innovation and technological findings - to raise awareness of farmers on the possibility of making value of the plastic waste stream - to stimulate the creation of new small businesses in the field of collection and recycling of plastic waste, - to promote the mainstreaming of results in regional and national policies.",
