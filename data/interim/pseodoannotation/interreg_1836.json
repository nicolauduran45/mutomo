  "title": "Integrated territorial strategies for Services of General Interest",
  "abstract": "Services of general interest (SGI) are in the competence of authorities at different levels. Up to now, authorities and the service providers tend to have a strictly sectorial approach to SGI which leads to isolated solutions, neither taking benefit of potential synergies nor optimizing the expense of public money. Therefore there is a need for a better horizontal and vertical coordination of SGI and for their inclusion into integrated territorial strategies. _x000D_ _x000D_ The main objective of Intesi is to assure the delivery of SGI in the long run via integrated, territorial strategies and policies. The Intesi project includes the following steps: _x000D_ 1) collection and analysis of all SGI strategies in the entire alpine space that are relevant for SGI delivery _x000D_ 2) regional profiles of 10 test areas (TAs) will be established in order to assess the status quo of SGI delivery and to detect challenges, needs and potentials in relation to SGI _x000D_ 3) A selection of new pilot activities (PA) will be implemented or existing ones supported in order to test strategies in place and to improve the offer of SGI delivery according to stakeholder needs _x000D_ 4) on the base of the preceeding steps, recommendations will be elaborated on how combining existing sectoral strategies into integrated territorial SGI strategies. _x000D_ 5) Via the Intesi think tank, SGI service providers, authorities and other relevant stakeholders will come together and exchange on SGI issues. _x000D_ _x000D_ This way the project results are fed into the implementation level and the political, strategical level. An effect which is also supported by the integration of policy relevant institutions as observers._x000D_ _x000D_ Intesi goes, with its focus on strategy development and transfer to policies, beyond other SGI projects such as PUSEMOR and ACCESS which had the implementation of pilot activities in the center of their interest.",
