  "abstract": "Calcários e mármores são rochas carbonatadas amplamente utilizadas no património construído Português e que se caracterizam por possuírem composição química e mineralógica similares apesar de apresentarem texturas e propriedades diversas. O presente artigo aborda este recurso mineral do ponto de vista da sua utilização como material de construção em bens de elevado valor cultural e foca dois casos com relevância histórica no panorama nacional: o mármore de Trigaches que aflora perto de Beja, no Baixo-Alentejo e a Pedra de Ançã outrora explorada em Cantanhede, Coimbra.",
