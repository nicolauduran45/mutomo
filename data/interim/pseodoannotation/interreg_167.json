  "abstract": "The objective of ALPMEDITERR is to create the touristic destination of Mediterranean Alps, through the structuration of its governance in the European Park, but also through the definition of a territorial strategy of sustainable tourism, capable to give value to the diversity and the peculiarity of this protected site, in particular regarding trekking. The project is conceived as a transition that has the goal to give operational capacities to the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation, that unites Mercantour Park and Maritime Alps Park. The latter is already in coordination with some project partners who are participating to the project World Heritage; at the end of this project they want to continue this cooperation experience through the construction of an integrated territorial initiative for a better definition of multi-sector integrated development.",
