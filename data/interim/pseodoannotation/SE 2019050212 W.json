  "title": "USER EQUIPMENT AND METHOD TO HANDLE ACCESS BARRING",
  "abstract": "A method performed by a User Equipment (UE) for handling access barring in a wireless communications network is provided. The UE obtains (1201) barring instructions from a network node. The UE further performs (1204) access barring check. When the outcome of the access barring check is that the UE is not authorized, the UE determines (1205) how to proceed based on the barring instructions.",
