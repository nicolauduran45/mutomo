  "abstract": "Certain innovation processes cannot be realized without people and their ideas. The project focuses on development of strategies that will safeguard human capital for these processes and establishes transnational cooperation for coping with this challenge, especially in the sector of engineering technology and science. Project partnership decided to look for a holistic European solutions by overcoming predominantly regionally focused methods when developing innovation strategies. The different regional approaches will be therefore improved, good practice examples defined and new opportunities for its further development determined. The project partnership consists of experienced and competent partners from the participating regions representing development agencies, business support and innovation agencies, as well as municipalities and universities from all 8 CE countries. It initiates the formation of co-operative structures between universities, educational institutions and regional decision makers, which constitute stable networks based on structural funding until the end of the project.",
