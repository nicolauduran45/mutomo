  "title": "Dynamic Monitoring of Dark IP Address Space (Poster)",
  "abstract": "Abstractnumber of security-related research topics are based on the monitoring of dark IP address space. Unfortunately there is large administrative overhead associated with the dynamic assignment of a specific subnet for monitoring purposes, such as the deployment of a honeypot farm or a distributed intrusion detection system. In this paper, we propose a system that enables the dynamic allocation of an unadvertised IP address subnet for use by a monitoring sensor. The system dynamically selects network subnets that have been allocated to the organization but are not being advertised, advertises them, and subsequently forwards all received traffic destined to the selected subnet to a monitoring sensor.KeywordsIntrusion Detection SystemMonitoring SensorBorder RouterDynamic PacketRout Table EntryThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors. This process is experimental and the keywords may be updated as the learning algorithm improves.",
