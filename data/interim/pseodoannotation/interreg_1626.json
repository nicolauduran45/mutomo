  "abstract": "HISTEK aims at enhancing SMEs’ capacities of competitiveness, innovation and internationalization, through the creation of a new  CBC cluster whose members are SMEs, Training Organizations and Public Institutions, strongly committed to set-up and carry on, with a co-responsible approach, a cross-border innovation community. In order to improve SMEs’ competitiveness and innovation, one of the most important leverage is represented by human resources, i.e. companies, especially those ones that have already or intend to establish new branches in CB area, need very highly qualified technicians according to CB common standards, to allow and to favor their mobility in the 3 Countries. For this reason HISTEK, will create the CBC cluster, that will work soundly to develop common tools for assessing SMEs’ needs in terms of human resources, and to create common standards to be adopted in the education systems for developing young highly qualified technicians. This represent in fact a strategic framework condition for the development of SME’s cross-border market.   The CBC Cluster will be immediately operative, through a pilot action whose key elements are: 1) creation of a CB Assessment Tool Kit to be used by SMEs in recruiting activities of young technicians; 2) design of a new join (IT-AL-ME) CB tertiary education course, to be implemented soon after the end of the project, able to train high specialized technicians with advanced high technical preparation, particularly focused on Key Enabling Technologies. In fact, KETs are considered essential for growth and employment, since they provide the basis for innovation in a wide range of industries; 3) dedicated toolkits and guidelines for improving the capacity of SMEs to deal with practical learnings inside the company and with mentoring activities. HISTEK wants to offer an effective and sustainable response to CB SMEs regarding the challenge of innovation against the economic crisis.",
