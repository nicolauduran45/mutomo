  "title": "Technology,Personal Network and Current Situation:The Rise and Development of Mayar Silk Mills (1920â€”1950)",
  "abstract": "Mayar Silk Mills was one of the biggest enterprises in the Chinese modern silk-weaving history. Technology,personal network and current situation at that time,had critical effect on its development. The interaction of those factors determined the development of Mayar. In the first phase,it took technology as the main means of competition,introducing new silk products and relying on the fostering skilled personnel. As it achieved a certain scale,network resources began to play an important role in its financing,management,marketing and other aspects. However,after the 1930s,the external political and economic environment played a more important role for enterprise strategies. In the special environment of wartime,Mayar expanded into a large-scale enterprise group. But the post-war environment extremely damaged the development of enterprises. Its business could not continue,and finally declined.",
