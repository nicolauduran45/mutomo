  "abstract": "The relations between physical parameters, and marine organisms, due to changes of climate in the marine environment are documented, but yet it remains impossible to forecast the trends in the marine ecosystem, for the reason of interrelations of the feedback nature, and phenomena due to anthropogenic impact. With this study it is proposed the pilot project for the distinguishing the parameters and processes that could be useful for the monitoring activity of the marine environment. The project consists of interdisciplinary study for evaluating the changes introduced from different climatic impacts at the physical properties of the marine ecosystem. ",
