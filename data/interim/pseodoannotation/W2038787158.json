  "abstract": "Twelve compounds belonging to series N-[3-chloro-2-oxo-4-(substituted)phenylazetidin-1-yl]-2-(3-methyl-2-oxoquinoxalin-1(2H)-yl)acetamide (5aâ€“l) were synthesized. These compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial against E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and antifungal activity against C. albicans, A. niger and A. flavus by cup-plate method. Structures of all the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by their spectral data interpretation. Compound 5g having p-dimethylaminophenyl group on 4-position of azetidinone ring attached to N-atom of acetamido group on 1-position of 3-methyl-1H-quinoxaline-2-one, was found to be active against all the bacterial and fungal strains under investigation. A new series of compounds belonging to N-[3-chloro-2-oxo-4-(substituted) phenylazetidin-1-yl]-2-(3-methyl-2-oxoquinoxalin-1(2H)-yl)acetamide was synthesized and all the newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities.",
