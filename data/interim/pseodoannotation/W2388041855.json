  "abstract": "The quality of human resources is the basic guarantee for regional development of socio-economic.The size of population,the quality and the structure of population have direct relations with existence of society and development of society.The quality of human resources evaluation indicator system of Gansu Province was established to carry on dimensionality reduction processing to the target of affect quality of the human resources with the factor analytic method,four close related factors were determined which respectively are the income level factor(LOIF:The Level of Income Factor),the medical condition factor(MCF:Medical Condition Factor),the science and technology education culture factor(SECF:Science and Education and Cultural Factors),the non-agricultural production factor(NAIF:Non-Agricultural Industries Factor).",
