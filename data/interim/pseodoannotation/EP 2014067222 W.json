  "abstract": "The invention relates to a locking unit (10) for a vehicle seat (1), comprising a lock housing having a receptacle opening (19) for receiving a locking bolt (12) and a rotary latch (20), mounted to be able to swivel around a first bearing bolt (51), which rotary latch (20) has a hook aperture (21) for locking together with a locking bolt (12). The bearing bolt (51) is aligned in an axial direction and the receptacle opening (19) is delimited by a stop element (61). The stop element (61) represents a stop for a locking bolt (12) located in the hook aperture, and the stop element (61) protrudes into the lock housing in the axial direction. When the locking unit (10) is in a locked state and the locking bolt (12) extends precisely in the axial direction, a first contact region (71) between the locking bolt (12) and the stop element (61) and a second contact region (72) between the locking bolt (12) and the rotary latch (20) partially overlap in the axial direction, or the first contact region (71) lies completely within the second contact region (72) in the axial direction. The invention further relates to a vehicle seat (1), comprising at least one such locking unit (10).",
