  "abstract": "L'invenzione riguarda un dispositivo di intercettazione e distribuzione di acqua miscelata a più vie, in particolare per box doccia, e consiste nell'aver concepito un unico dispositivo avente la funzione sia di valvola di intercettazione che di distribuzione. Ciò si realizza con un dispositivo in cui i comandi di intercettazione e di distribuzione sono disposti in posizione coassiale, il condotto di arrivo dell'acqua miscelata in posizione centrale ed i vari condotti di uscita disposti a corona intorno al condotto di entrata.",
