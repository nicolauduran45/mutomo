  "title": "A thz communication evaluation kit",
  "abstract": "The FASTERA evaluation kit is a THz receiver designed for next-generation 6G technology covering indoor and short-range environments. The FASTERA kit is intended to answer the increasing data-rate demand of current consumer and industrial markets. The THz evaluation kit goes beyond the capabilities of current 5G technology, enabling the exploitation of the THz frequency range for data communication applications. The FASTERA kit is based on a patented antenna-coupled graphene-enabled detector able to operate at room temperature, with high sensitivity (~80 pW/Hz1/2), fast response (>100 GHz), and broadband (from 100 GHz up to 5 THz) tuneable spectral range defined by the antenna itself. The FASTERA evaluation kit will be defined in collaboration with Ericsson and will be tested in a 6G communications testbed.",
