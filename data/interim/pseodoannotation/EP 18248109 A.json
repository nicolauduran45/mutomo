  "title": "QUATERNARY NICOTINAMIDE DERVIATIVES AS PRECURSORS FOR RELEASE OF MNA",
  "abstract": "The invention concerns pyridine salts derivatives which are O-substituted halides of 3-oxymethylaminocarbonyl-1-methylpyridine and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Disclosed compounds may be used as a medicament due to observed release of the active substance - N1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) by these compounds. Preferably compounds are claimed for use in the treatment or prevention of diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction. The invention also concerns the method of MNA release and the use of pyridine salts derivatives for selective release of MNA.",
