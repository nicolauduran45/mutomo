  "abstract": "The present invention discloses a reagent for detecting axillary lymph node metastasis of breast cancers and application thereof. Application of 18F-Alfatide II, or a combination of 18F-Alfatide II and 18F-FDG in PET/CT detection of axillary lymph node metastasis of breast cancers. A PET/CT tracer 18F-Alfatide II or 18F-FDG is intravenously injected into patients, followed by a PET/CT examination, 18F-Alfatide II T/NT has the highest Youden index (76.5%), specificity (100%), accuracy (89.2%), and positive predictive value (100%). These data indicates that 18F-Alfatide II T/NT may be the most valuable semi-quantitative parameter for evaluating axillary lymph nodes.",
