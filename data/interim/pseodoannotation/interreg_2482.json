  "title": "Nature Based Solutions for Domestic Water Reuse in Mediterranean Countries",
  "abstract": "In Mediterranean countries, domestic water use accounts for a minor part of water consumption - a much larger quantity is used for irrigation - but it requires the best quality and its demand is continuously growing, along with improving lifestyle and increasing urban population. Moreover, urban water is still the main cause of pollution of rivers and groundwater, even when treated before being discharged. Per capita domestic water use can be drastically reduced by using non-conventional water (NCW) resources for not potable purposes: greywater (and rainwater when available) can be reused for WC flushing and irrigation but requires the implementation of decentralised treatment systems, serving one or a few buildings. NAWAMED aims at changing the urban water management practice by mean of innovative, sustainable, and low-cost treatment technologies, applicable in a decentralised way, to replace the use of potable water with good quality of NCW.",
