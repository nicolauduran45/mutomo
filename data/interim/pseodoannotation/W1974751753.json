  "title": "Study on human resource management in Korea'schaebolenterprise: a case study of Samsung Electronics",
  "abstract": "Korean chaebol firms have taken advantage of the ownerâ€“management system and to date are still enjoying its strength. I discuss the characteristics of human resources management (HRM) systems in the context of Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest chaebol following the Asian crisis of 1997, explaining why the SEC HRM system should be changed and what recent changes have been made, as perceived by both respondents and HR manager interviewees. The study of SEC HRM practices can provide real value to Western companies because it incorporates firm-specific advantages such as network strength, emperor-like power over group-wide management, and an agile decision-making process.",
