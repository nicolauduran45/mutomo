  "title": "PRONAF:Programa Nacional de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar fazendo mais do mesmo no Brasil?",
  "abstract": "El propósito de este artículo es discutir, como el PRONAF (Programa Nacional de Fortalecimiento de la Agricultura familiar) mientras que es una política púbica de \"Fortalecimiento de la Agricultura Familiar\" ha contribuido para el aumento de la producción de mercancías (commodities para exportación) en zonas predominantes de agricultores familiares. Para tanto, fue realizado una investigación en áreas de agricultura familiar no norte do Rio Grande do Sul nos anos de 2017-18. Donde, analizaran algunas consideraciones sobre la estructura agraria, así como los datos de aumento de la productividad y el área utilizada en la producción de los principales cultivos de exportación en los años 2000-2018. E también algunas consideraciones de los entornos rurales cómo este modelo de agricultura ha degradado los ambientes, especialmente con el aumento de las tasas de aplicación de pesticidas a cada año en Río Grande del Sur y Brasil. Como resultados se observó que este modelo basado en la financiación pública significativa ha mantenido la pobreza rural, el endeudamiento y la dependencia de algunas regiones con fuerte producción primaria a expensas de otras regiones más industrializadas. Por último, presentamos una discusión sobre la necesidad de revisar el papel de las políticas públicas que promuevan la seguridad alimentaria, la recuperación y protección del medio ambiente mediante la promoción de la agroecología en zonas con presencia de los agricultores pobres de Brasil.",
