  "abstract": "The invention relates to a high-voltage device (1), comprising an inner conductor (2), an insulating body (6), which surrounds the inner conductor along the longitudinal direction of the inner conductor and which comprises electrically conductive control inserts (7-9) for field control, which are arranged concentrically around the inner conductor and are spaced apart from each other by insulating layers, and an electrically conductive connection between the inner conductor and a first control insert (7) closest to the inner conductor. The invention is characterized by an electrically conductive connection between the inner conductor and a second control insert (8), which axially extends beyond the first control insert to a foot end (12) of the high-voltage device.",
