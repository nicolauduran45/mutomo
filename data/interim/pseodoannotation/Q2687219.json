  "abstract": "SA 42799(2015/X) O tema do projeto é o desenvolvimento de um novo dispositivo, «esquentador inteligente de pacientes com circulação de ar forçada com coberturas de uso único dedicados», projetado para prevenir a hipotermia, mantendo a temperatura corporal adequada em um paciente exposto a resfriamento e/ou aquecimento do paciente resfriado. O dispositivo será especialmente dedicado à aplicação de áreas que, devido à especificidade, requerem o uso de coberturas para uso em apenas um paciente — ou seja, internações hospitalares, pronto-socorro hospitalar, anestesiologia e departamento de terapia intensiva, enfermarias infecciosas. Durante a criação da nova, será tida em conta a experiência do contratante recolhida durante o projeto «Sistema de Aquecimento de Doentes Inteligentes». Entre outras coisas, será implementada uma interface gráfica de utente, utilizando um ecrã tátil com um sistema de comunicação conversacional, o que representará uma inovação significativa em relação às soluções presentes no mercado. Um sistema avançado de segurança do trabalho será usado, incluindo o uso de múltiplos sensores de temperatura e funções de autodiagnóstico. O novo dispositivo atenderá aos crescentes requisitos relacionados ao cumprimento dos padrões epidemiológicos, através do uso de capas de uso único, do uso de filtros de ar de alta qualidade, da adaptação do dispositivo principal para desinfeção em condições hospitalares. O projeto terá em conta as necessidades dos utilizadores e dos atuais clientes do requerente. Entre outras coisas, o dispositivo será caracterizado por trabalho silencioso, permitirá monitorar a terapia individual do paciente e terá várias opções de montagem, incluindo a disponibilidade de um stand móvel. O envolvimento dos utilizadores finais no processo de criação de um novo produto consistirá em examinar as necessidades e, em seguida, em ensaios funcionais do protótipo do dispositivo e verificar o seu desempenho em relação aos requisitos e pressupostos definidos.",
