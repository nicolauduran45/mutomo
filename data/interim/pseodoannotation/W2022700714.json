  "abstract": "Demographic Situation and the Level of Human Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan: Regional Aspects The objects of research are indicators of human development in Kazakhstan from the moment of independence acquisition by the republic until today. The subject of scientific research is spatial-existential patterns of socio-demographic processes as a key factor of human potential development in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The importance of scientific work is that the results permit to estimate the level of human development of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the basis of socio-demographic processes. For the first time the basic indicators defining human potential in Kazakhstan have been studied in detail and systematized. The aim of the work is to define the laws of the spatial organization of human potential and its basic spatial analyses of human development of Kazakhstan. The database, created with the help of ArcGIS, allows to monitor the changes of human development level, to analyze, estimate and manage human potential of the Republic of Kazakhstan.",
