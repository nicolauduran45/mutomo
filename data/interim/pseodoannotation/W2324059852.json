  "title": "Improvement in efficiency of fibre utilization by the Canadian forest products industry 1970 to 2010",
  "abstract": "The Canadian forest products industry uses as much as 200 million cubic metres of wood per year to make a wide variety of products. The three main sectors produce millions of tonnes of pulp and paper, many million cubic metres of sawn lumber and a growing volume of wood-based panels. How efficient are we at making useful products from the vast volumes of conifers and hardwoods harvested each year? Is the utilization efficiency of the industry improving, stagnant or declining? Over the 40-year period covered by this report our efficiency has improved significantly. In 1970 only 61% of harvested wood was converted into useful products. In 2010 utilization efficiency had improved and 83% of harvested wood was converted to products to serve the needs of our customers around the world.",
