  "abstract": "A device (1, 10, 11, 12, 13) for storing and delivering liquids comprising a watertight bag (2, 102, 112, 122, 132) having at least one opening (3, 103, 113, 123, 133) and a delivery system (5, 6, 7, 8) operatively connected to said opening; the device further comprises a first (20, 60) and a second (30, 70) stiff surfaces connected by flexible flanks (40, 50, 80, 90). The delivery system comprises a connection locking device (200) for connecting the fluid-carrying pipes and fitting system, which comprises a spigot (201) inserted in the collar (501) of a hose (51), an external compression ring (202) positioned onto the portion of the collar (501) which is covering the spigot and a conical threaded sleeve (203) locking said external compression ring (202) onto said portion of the collar covering the spigot.",
