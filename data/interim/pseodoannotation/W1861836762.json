  "title": "Antifungal activity of extracts of Ocimum gratissimum and Aframomum danielli against moulds isolated from stored rice",
  "abstract": "The fungitoxic effect of extracts of Ocimum gratissimum and Aframomum danielli on some moulds isolated from rice grains were determined in vitro. Aqueous extracts of Aframomum danielli inhibited the radial growth of the moulds at different levels between 46.4 - 56.7%. Aspergillus niger (56.7%) was the most sensitive to Aframomum danielli while Cladosporium sphaerospermum (46.4%) was the least sensitive. Ocimum gratissimum extract inhibited the radial growth of the moulds between 46.4 – 59.7% with Penicillium citrinum showing the highest sensitivity and C. sphaerospermum being the least sensitive. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the effect of Ocimum gratissimum and Aframomum danielli on all the moulds. Ocimum gratissimum showed the greater antifungal activity against the storage fungi (mean = 53.4%) compared to Aframomum danielli (mean = 51.9%). However, there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the effect  of Ocimum gratissimum and Aframomum danielli on the storage fungi. Both plant products showed varying levels of fungitoxic activities and could be potentially used in the storage of Ofada and Abakaliki rice against moulds.
