  "title": "AN OIL PUMP ASSEMBLY FOR A VEHICLE LUBRICATION SYSTEM",
  "abstract": "The invention provides an oil pump assembly for a vehicle lubrication system comprising a pumping device (301), the oil pump assembly presenting an outlet (302) leading from the pumping device (301), and an inlet (303) leading to the pumping device (301), the oil pump assembly further comprising a relief valve (5) presenting a valve chamber (501) arranged to communicate via an outlet relief passage (502) with the outlet (302), and to communicate via a relief deposit passage (503) with a relief deposit location (504), the relief valve (5) further comprising a plunger (505) located in the valve chamber (501), the plunger (505) being movable between a closed position, in which communication between the outlet relief passage (502) and the relief deposit passage (503) is prevented, and an open position, in which communication between the outlet relief passage (502) and the relief deposit passage (503) is provided, the oil pump assembly further comprising a control valve (4) for controlling the relief valve (5), and a control passage (401) adapted to provide a communication between the outlet (302) and the control valve (4) via the valve chamber (501).",
