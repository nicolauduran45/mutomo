  "title": "UPDATING SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THROUGH ONLINE STORES",
  "abstract": "The present invention extends to methods, systems, and computer program products for updating software components through online stores. A computing device interacts with an online store to download applications and frameworks that are distributed from the online store. The computer system includes an operating system configured to keep distributed applications and frameworks updated. The operating system can, automatically and without user intervention, intelligently schedule and attempt application and framework updates in a manner that minimizes user disruptions. The operating system can manage application and framework updating for any and/or all user accounts on a computing device. The operating system can manage updates even when each application and/or framework is to be separately installed for different user accounts that have the application and/or framework installed.",
