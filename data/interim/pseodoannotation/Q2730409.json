  "title": "Path — Increasing capacity and improving the productive technologies of frozzen Food International",
  "abstract": "The purpose of the project is to increase production capacity, enhance productive technologies and strengthen the regional competitiveness of frozfrozen Food International. The proposed activities will make it possible to bridge the company’s central problem — a lower competitiveness of the company due to limited production and technological capacity to meet the growing demand for a company’s product. By carrying out the project, the company will increase the production capacity by 600 %, improve the production process and develop new competences, thus strengthening its regional competitiveness, leading to a 95 % increase in sales revenue, an increase of exports revenue by 110 % and the creation of 12 new jobs. The project target groups are the firm itself and its employees.",
