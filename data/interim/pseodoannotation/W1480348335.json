  "title": "Anode Baking Process Improvement at ALRO",
  "abstract": "Along with the partial refractory refurbishment of their three anode baking furnaces, ALRO wanted to reduce their consumption of natural gas and achieve complete combustion of the volatile compounds. Fives Solios proposed its process control expertise and up-to-date technology to upgrade the existing Firing Control System. Advanced software along with CO analysers and high velocity gas injectors were implemented for better combustion control. Port Sealing Ramp and low pressure drop dampers were provided to improve the operating conditions of the furnaces. Additionally, baking profile adjustments, based on CO continuous measurement and balance between the draft and the thermal demand in the heating zones, were jointly conducted by ALRO and Fives Solios resulting in a sustainable reduction of the energy consumption and improved combustion of the volatile compounds while maintaining a consistent anode quality.",
