  "abstract": "The present disclosure provides a two-part jack socket for a portable electronic device and a portable electronic device having the same. In accordance with one example embodiment, the jack socket comprises: a first part having a contact surface; a second part having a contact surface and being moveable with respect to the first part between a first position and a second position, the contact surfaces of the first part and second part defining a cavity, the cavity having a retracted state when the second part is in the first position and an expanded state for receiving a jack plug when the second part is in the second position; and one or more contacts located in the contact surface of the first part or second part.
