  "abstract": "The proposed actions aim at promoting local and regional resilience by developing the knowledge base required to identify suitable climate adaptation and planning options. The goal will be supported by four actions: produce high-resolution datasets and projections that provide detailed and reliable information on climate-related impacts in the regions; create a climate information system or knowledge platform for the Adriatic region containing best practices, guidance documents, legal frameworks and climate and vulnerability studies; test and integrate the knowledge platform in select Italian and Croatian pilot cities and extended urban areas where adaptation and resilience plans will be designed; maintain and disseminate the information. Information added on 2020-12_10, regarding the mitigation of the effects of COVID-19 (the coronavirus pandemic that started in 2019) (English language only): ADRIADAPT supports Local Authorities implementing climate policies, The reduction of emissions achieved by climate mitigation and urban greening will help improving air quality and so reducing vectors of infection; COVID 19 experiences have taught that preparation of emergency services need to take such (unforeseen) disruptive events in consideration too, in order to increase resilience at local level. Aiming at the creation of attractive urban green areas as part of climate adaptation solutions has demonstrated clear advantages for living through the COVID crisis as these areas have a high importance for safer forms of social interaction and well-being in a context of social distancing.",
