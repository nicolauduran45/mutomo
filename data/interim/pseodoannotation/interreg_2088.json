  "abstract": "The LUMAT project objective is the implementation of Sustainable Land Use and pilot projects in Integrated Environmental Management in 7 Central European Functional Urban Areas. The LUMAT partnership of cities and regions, environmental agencies and research institutions develop integrated \"Functional Areas Management Strategies (FAMS)\" with shared transnational territorial and scientific competence. FAMS will include planning strategies with innovative technology supported with citizen participation. Local stakeholders will initiate pilot projects by using new interactive information tools from the Urban Atlas and citizen observatories. The ecosystem service concept will support the assessment and decision-making process. The implementation will be based on agreed action plans and pilot/demonstration projects for land and soil including information base and tool for the management of urban-peri-urban relationships. Action plans include financial instruments and institutional solutions e.g. land management agencies or permanent intermunicipal working groups. Tools on FAMS methodology and participation will be an integrative part of FAMS (minimize threats and environmental compensation to get more liveable places starting with the pilots in all regions (successful brownfield redevelopment, green infrastructure, sustainable land use on contaminated land). The project relies on the interplay between strategies and instruments beyond existing practice and on a suitably comprehensive deployment of tools in these areas, including terms of reference (WP1), cooperation, organisation and management by action plans (WP2), investment and pilot actions (WP3). The proposal has already been developed at regional stakeholders meetings and one international workshop in Vienna. All partners committed their engagement by Letters of Support to the Lead Partner. The transfer of outputs and dissemination includes international networks AESOP, ECTP-CEU and ISOCARP, METREX",
