  "abstract": "A frozen drink and dessert dispenser (100) and method therefor. The frozen drink and dessert dispenser and method permits the simultaneous or alternate dispensing of two products. Further, through a dispensing valve system (400) controlled by a controller (502, 512), residue of dispensed product is purged from the product dispenser (100) prior to the dispensing of the next serving of product and product may be dispensed in predetermined amounts. The frozen drink and dessert dispenser (100) and method also permits the automated cleaning of substantially all of the dispenser without any significant disassembly of the dispenser.",
