  "abstract": "espanolObjetivo: evaluar el alivo del dolor mediante la escala visual analogica (EVA) en pacientes con dolor cronico de origen vertebral despues de la valoracion conjunta y recibir tratamiento por un equipo multidisciplinar. Material y metodo: estudio prospectivo de 82 pacientes consecutivos con patologia raquidea que han sido valorados por el Grupo de trabajo medico (Servicio de Rehabilitacion y Unidad del dolor). Se ha volarado la intensidad del dolor mediante el EVA, previo al tratamiento especifico segun la etiopatogenia del dolor, y a los 3 meses de su realizacion. Asimismo se han evaluado las patologias asociadas (PA) y su correlacion con la causa y el alivio del dolor. Estudio estadistico mediante el programa SPSS. Resultados: el tiempo de evolucion del problema de salud fue de 31,1 meses (DE 22,17). La espera para la visita conjunta fue de 2,9 semanas (DE 1,95). La clinica principal fue la lumbociatalgia en un 83,5% de los pacientes, siendo la patologia de canal estrecho el diagnostico principal en el 45,1% de los casos, seguido de la patologia degenerativa (14,6%) y de la estenosis foraminal (11,7%). Se evaluo el EVA inicial y a los 3 meses de la intervencion terapeutica ya sea con tratamiento conservador o con tecnicas minimamente invasivas (TMI). Las tecnicas terapeuticas empleadas fueron: infiltraciones epidurales (28 casos), bloqueos foraminales (15), bloqueos facetarios (5), estimulacion electrica transcutanea (3), tratamiento farmacologico (15) y en 16 casos se requirio mas de una tecnica. El EVA medio inicial fue de 7,75 y a los 3 meses fue de 4,94 existiendo diferencias clinicamente significativas. Asimismo existe una correlacion positiva entre la edad y el numero de PA, pero no entre el EVA inicial/final y el numero de PA. Tambien se ha observado correlacion positiva entre el EVA y la etiopatogenia del dolor. Conclusion: los resultados obtenidos reafirman la necesidad de optimizar los recursos sanitarios utilizados con el fin de mejorar la eficiencia y la eficacia terapeutica. EnglishAim: to evaluate the pain relief with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in pacients with chronic spinal pain after receiving treatment and the assessment of a multidisciplinary team. Material and method: prospective study with 82 consecutive patients with spinal pain which have been assessed by the Medical team (Rehabilitation Department and Pain Unit). The intensity of pain have been evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before specific treatment regarding the etiopathology of pain and after 3 months. Also the associated pathologies (AP) and their correlation with the cause and the relief of pain have been assessed. The statistical study has been performed with SPSS. Results: the evolution time of the health problem was 31.1 months (SD 22.17). The waiting time fot the team visit was 2.9 weeks (SD 1.95). The main pathology was lumbosciatalgia (83.5% of the patients), being the narrowing of the spinal canal the main diagnose (45.1% of the cases), followed by the degenerative pathology (14.6%) and the foraminal stenosis (11.7%). The VAS was administered at the beginning and 3 months after the therapeutic intervention, both in the case of conservative treatment or with minimally invasive techniques (MIT). The therapeutic methods used were: epidural infiltrations (28 cases), foraminal blocks (15), facetary block (5), transcutaneous electrical stimulation (3), pharmacological treatment (15) and, in 16 cases, more than one technique was recquired. The mean initial VAS was 7.75 and 4.94 after 3 months, existing clinically significative differences. Also there is a positive correlation between the age and the number of APs, but not between the initial/final VAS and the number of APs. Finally a positive correlation between the VAS and the etiopathogeny of pain was found. Conclusion: the results obtained reassert the need to optimize the sanitary resources used in order to improve the therapeutic efficiency and efficacy.",
