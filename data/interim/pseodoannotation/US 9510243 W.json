  "title": "CONFORMABLE INSULATION ASSEMBLY",
  "abstract": "A conformable insulation assembly (40) is provided and includes a mineral fiber batt (20) of a binderless fibrous material of substantially long fibers. The insulation assembly (40) is capable of conforming and expanding its shape to an area into which it is installed better than prior art insulation assemblies.",
