  "title": "Alternative Technique reducing complexity of Maximum Attribute Relation",
  "abstract": "Clustering refers to the method grouping the large data into the smaller groups based on the similarity measure. Clustering techniques have been applied on numerical, categorical and mix data. One of the categorical data clustering technique based on the soft set theory is Maximum Attribute Relation (MAR). The MAR technique allows calculating all of pair multi soft set made. However, the computational complexity is still an issue of the technique. To overcome the drawback, the paper proposes the alternative algorithm to decrease the complexity so get the faster response time. In this paper, to get the similar results as MAR without calculating all pair of soft set is proved. The alternative algorithm is implemented in MATLAB Software, and then experimental is run on the 10 benchmark datasets. The results show that the alternative algorithm improves the computational complexity in term of response time up to 36.46%",
