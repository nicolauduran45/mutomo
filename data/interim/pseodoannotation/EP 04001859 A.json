  "abstract": "Aspects of the invention include receiving a first packet from a first of a plurality of blade servers at a first data rate and determining a second blade server that may receive the first packet. Data responsive to the received first packet may be transferred to the second blade server at a negotiated first data rate. A second packet comprising at least a portion of the first received packet may be transferred to the second blade server at the negotiated data rate. At least a portion of the first received packet may be transferred to at least the second blade server via a common bus. In another aspect of the invention, at least a third packet may be received from a network at a second data rate. Data responsive to the third packet may be transferred to at least a third blade server at a newly negotiated data rate.",
