  "abstract": "Si riporta l’elenco dei macrolepidotteri notturni raccolti nel territorio compreso fra i fiumi Alli e Simeri, sul versante sud-orientale del massiccio montuoso della Sila. A quote comprese fra i 650 e i 90 metri sul livello del mare, sono stati indagati 10 siti rappresentativi delle principali formazioni forestali del comprensorio, principalmente quercete termofile e boschi ripari. Con l’ausilio di trappole luminose a LED UV, attivate a cadenza mensile da giugno 2019 ad aprile 2021, sono stati catturati 20.366 esemplari appartenenti a 429 specie. Le più abbondanti sono strettamente legate alla copertura forestale (Eupithecia dodoneata, Cyclophora puppillaria, Watsonalla uncinula e diverse specie di Catocala) oppure hanno ampia valenza ecologica (Peribatodes rhomboidaria, Idaea filicata, I. degeneraria, Eilema caniola). Di particolare interesse biogeografico sono il rinvenimento di Cryphia receptricula, per la prima volta segnalata in Calabria, Aegle agatha, nota in Italia per tre località, Horisme exoletata, segnalata finora in Italia continentale soltanto in questa area, Denticucullus pygmina e Orectis proboscidata, note per una sola località calabrese. 44 specie vengono segnalate per la prima volta nel comprensorio silano e 7 per la costa ionica.",
