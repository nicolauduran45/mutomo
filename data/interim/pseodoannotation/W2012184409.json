  "title": "Parametric Analysis for Ultimate Strength Prediction of Stainless Steel Bolted Joints with Single Bolt",
  "abstract": "A variety of parametric studies utilizing the finite element analysis (FEA) have been performed by Kim et al in order to predict the mechanical behavior(ultimate strength) of single shear bolted joints in cold-formed(thin-walled) stainless steel. The precedent researches have been conducted with respect to the mechanical behaviors of single shear bolted joints fabricated with four bolts and two bolts. Subsequently, this study has been focused on the comparison of ultimate behaviors between the existing test results and FEA results. In addition, parametric study has been performed in order to investigate the influence of mesh size and washer existence on ultimate behaviors. Therefore, reasonable finite element modelling method and condition were recommended in this paper.",
