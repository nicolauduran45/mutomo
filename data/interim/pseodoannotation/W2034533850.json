  "title": "Centralized heart rate monitoring telemetry system using ZigBee wireless sensor network",
  "abstract": "Recent advances in wireless communication standards and medical monitoring system have made it possible to effectively combine mesh networking with Non-Invasive medical application which is Pulse Oximeter in order to create reliable, large-scale wireless Network. This Mesh networking will enable doctors and nurses to observe and monitor a number of patients simultaneously from one location without being with the patient's physically. This project is mainly concerned about monitoring patient's condition simultaneously via Wireless Mesh Network. Wireless Mesh Network is a network that allows data transmitted to the node's nearest neighbors and it can be easily maintained as each node are self configuring and self healing. Data obtained from multiple pulse oximeters will be stored and processed using Arduino-Nano, then transmitted to a centralized unit, where the information for multiple oximeter will be displayed simultaneously. The efficiency of data transmission was monitored and verified. Mesh networking for pulse oximeter had been successfully design to show the active pulse oximeter. Besides, the data transmit and received by the XBee were accurate and it had been proved through several observations.",
