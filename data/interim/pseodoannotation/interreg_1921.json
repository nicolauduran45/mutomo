  "abstract": "The main goal of InCIMA project is the establishment of a delocalized cross-border infrastructure for the synthesis and characterization of functional smart materials at nano, micro and macro level, through the exploitation of state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques of imaging and mapping, that employ a wide radiation range, from far infrared to hard X-rays. The cooperation will be realized by the synergic complementation and the improvement of several analytic techniques and synthetic approaches, nowadays employed by each partner individually, for the optimization of two material types: _x000D_ _x000D_ 1- Totally natural rigid foams derived from byproducts of wood industries, such as tannin and lignin, to be used as new materials for green-building (for thermic and acoustic isolation), as well as for water purification from contaminants of emerging concern (natural filtering systems) – OBJECTIVE 1, _x000D_ _x000D_ 2- Plasmonic metamaterials to be used in the infrared and ultraviolet spectral range, for application as sensor of diluted chemical analytes, for environmental and biomedical diagnosis. The ultimate vision of integration of contaminant absorption capacity and dilute analyte detection within a single material, such as the bio-foam, will be forecasted – OBJECTIVE 2.",
