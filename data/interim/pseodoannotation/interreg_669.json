  "title": "Upgraded Health Structures in the Cross Border Area",
  "abstract": "In recent years there has been a constant movement of patients from rural to urban areas. Within this framework of healthcare disparity within regions, the project aims to:                                                                          • Create upgraded secondary care structures for citizens in the cross border area • Increase the quality of health service provision both to local and moving population (tourists, migrants etc).                                                                            • Improve provided services • Eliminate the conditions excluding sensitive social groups by encouraging cross border healthcare cooperation among structures and their management ",
