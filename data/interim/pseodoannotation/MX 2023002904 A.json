  "abstract": "Compositions comprising at least one dialkyl amino acid ester salt as a cationic active are disclosed. The compositions are useful for hair care, as well as in other applications, such as cleaning compositions, fabric softening compositions, and skin care compositions. The dialkyl amino acid ester salts are derived from the esterification reaction of an amino acid having at least two carboxylic acid groups with a fatty alcohol, wherein the amine group of the amino acid is protonated with an acid. The compositions may further include a glyceride component comprising monoglycerides, diglycerides, or a combination thereof.",
