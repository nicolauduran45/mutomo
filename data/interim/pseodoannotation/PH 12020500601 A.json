  "title": "CONTRACEPTIVE COMPOSITION WITH REDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS",
  "abstract": "The present invention relates to a contraceptive method with reduced cardiovascular effects, such as reduced thromboembolism risk, such as reduced venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk and reduced aortic thromboembolism (ATE) risk. The method of the invention comprises administering to a female mammal an effective amount of an estetrol component in combination with a progestogenic component. The method enjoys a favourable profile for thromboembolism compared to currently available methods which employs contraceptives from the so-called second, third or fourth generation.",
