  "abstract": "A time-dependent wavepacket diffusion method is used to investigate the effects of charge transfer (CT) states, singlet exciton, and multiexciton migrations on singlet fission (SF) dynamics in organic aggregates. The results reveal that the incorporation of CT states can result in SF dynamics different from the direct interaction between singlet exciton and multiexciton, and an obvious SF interference is also observed between the direct channel and the indirect channel mediated by CT states. In the case of direct interaction, although the fast population transfer of singlet exciton in monomers, caused by the increase of exciton–exciton interaction, can accelerate the SF process, the spatial coherence alternatively has a counter-productive effect, and their competition leads to an optimal exciton–exciton interaction at which SF has a maximal rate. This trade-off relationship in SF dynamics is further analyzed from different perspectives, specifically in spatial and energy representations, and is also confi...",
