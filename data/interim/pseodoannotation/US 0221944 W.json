  "title": "SELF TAPPING SPRAY NOZZLE FOR VEHICLE VENTILATION SYSTEM",
  "abstract": "A self tapping spray nozzle (10) for use in a vehicle ventilation system is preferably made of stainless steel. The spray nozzle has a neck (12) with an internal channel (34) and threads (17) cut into its outside surface. A wedge at a thirty degree angle, having sharpened edges is at the top of the neck. At least one port (14, 15) extends from the channel to the outside surface of the neck. A collar (13) with a plurality of sides (19) encompasses the circumference of the neck at its bottom. One side of the collar is aligned with the port to help align the port in a desired direction.",
