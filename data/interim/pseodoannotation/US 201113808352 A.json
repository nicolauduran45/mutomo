  "title": "DEVICE AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING COMPRESSOR, AND REFRIGERATOR INCLUDING SAME",
  "abstract": "Disclosed are a compressor control device, a method for controlling a compressor, and a refrigerator including the same. The present invention enables: a compressor to be driven by using a mode selectively to be driven by an inverter and a mode which directly uses a supply voltage, according to the quality of electricity of the supply voltage; loss which is caused by the use of the inverter to be reduced or removed by directly providing the supply voltage to the compressor within a certain voltage or frequency range; and increased energy efficiency by reducing power consumption.",
