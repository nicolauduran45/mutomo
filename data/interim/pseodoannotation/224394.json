  "abstract": "The overall objective of the RETINAL initiative of ULMA Embedded Solutions is to develop non-invasive and cost-effective tools with capacity for prevention and/or early detection of various diseases related to NCD complications, by analyzing the changes in the microvasculature of the retina.The basic framework of RETINAL is a comprehensive solution for ophthalmic imaging analysis and treatment composed of a simple, reliable and cost-effective color fundus digital image capture device and several specific software modules associated to the device for a number of specific clinical applications.The goal of this action is to demonstrate in the market, by independent peers, that RETINAL is the best available and cost-effective technology for the detection of diabetic retinopathy in DR Screening Programmes, and particularly valuable for its implementation at primary health centres, which makes screening more accessible to patients and therefore more effectiveThe overall objective of the RETINAL initiative of ULMA Embedded Solutions is to develop non-invasive and cost-effective tools with capacity for prevention and/or early detection of various diseases related to NCD complications, by analyzing the changes in the microvasculature of the retina.The basic framework of RETINAL is a comprehensive solution for ophthalmic imaging analysis and treatment composed of a simple, reliable and cost-effective color fundus digital image capture device and several specific software modules associated to the device for a number of specific clinical applications.The goal of this action is to demonstrate in the market, by independent peers, that RETINAL is the best available and cost-effective technology for the detection of diabetic retinopathy in DR Screening Programmes, and particularly valuable for its implementation at primary health centres, which makes screening more accessible to patients and therefore more effective",
