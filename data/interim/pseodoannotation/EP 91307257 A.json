  "abstract": "A moisture-permeable waterproof fabric has a resin layer formed on at least one surface thereof, wherein the resin layer is composed of a mixture comprising a product obtained by reacting a urethane prepolymer having isocyanate terminals with an N-carboxyamino acid anhydride and an amine, and a polyurethane having a 100% modulus of at least 40 kg/cm<2>, the amount of the resin product in the resin layer is 12.9 to 85.3 wt% of total solid resin, and the amount of the urethane/amino acid copolymer contained in the resin layer is 0.9 to 9.0% wt of total solid resin. The fabric has both an excellent moisture permeability and waterproofness, as well as an excellent abrasion resistance and washing fastness.",
