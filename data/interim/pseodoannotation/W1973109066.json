  "title": "Corrosion and thermal characterization of styrene based copolymers",
  "abstract": "Abstract Films from copolymers with resistance to wear, corrosion and thermal degradation as well as other important functions have been applied in many fields. It is known that the introduction of anionic hydrophilic groups in the polymer enhances its adhesion to substrates and protective function. In the present work, copolymers of styrene with acrylic, methacrylic and itaconic acids were prepared by polymerization in toluene with benzoyl peroxide initiation (BPO) and have been tested as anticorrosive films. The copolymers were analyzed by FTIR and TGA methods. Polarizing microscope images were employed to characterize the anticorrosive properties of the formed films. All copolymers produced in this work show strong adhesion to the substrate.",
