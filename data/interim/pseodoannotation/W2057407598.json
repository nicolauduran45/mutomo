  "title": "Internal dosimetry of 210Pb in the human cranium: preliminary results from instrumentation needs for in vivo counting in a low-background underground counting facility",
  "abstract": "Internal dosimetry of (210)Pb in the cranium deals with the determination of the amount of energy deposited in tissue by (210)Pb radiations within the cranium. (210)Pb in the human cranium was monitored by in vivo counting in a low background facility 640 m (2100 ft) underground with a germanium (Ge) gamma-ray detector having a beryllium window. The minimum detectable activity (MDA) was established with this system to be 0.2 Bq (5 pCi) in 25-h counting time with a 15-mm diameter and 7-mm thick Ge detector, having a beryllium window of thickness of 0.08 mm, in contact with the cranium just above the ear adjacent to the temple region. To establish an MDA of 0.004 Bq (0.1 pCi) with this system, the limitation arising from the ambient radon level at 10 Bq m(-3) was investigated.",
