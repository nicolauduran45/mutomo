  "title": "Implementation of an innovative product in the form of a smart fibre switch on the market.",
  "abstract": "The product that will be created during the implementation of the project will be an intelligent switch with a controller and software for passporting fiber optic networks, detecting ports and detecting failure sites. The product technically and functionally has the characteristics of product innovation. The product by combining commonly used light wave propagation technology (i.e. visible light) in fiber optic networks and widely available optical components (splitters) will allow for new functionalities, previously unavailable in switches available on the market. The implementation of additional optical signals (which acts as an information signal) in the main transmission track allows to create an innovative solution for connection detection, monitoring and process automation. Allows you to create real-time connection maps â€“ passporting (so far, in most cases available by manual input of data). At the same time, remote solution used, fully automated detection of the occurrence of a failure site, and reveals any malfunctions in the operation of the optical network, which affects the time and human resources required to resolve failures in the case of standard crossings.",
