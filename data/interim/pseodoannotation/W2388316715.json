  "title": "Statistical prediction of dielectric single-surface multipactor discharge under mixed field",
  "abstract": "A statistical method is used to analyze the evolutions of the important physical values in the dielectric single-surface multipactor discharge process with the number of collisions,such as the number of second emission electron,DC field,deposited power on dielectric,and electron transit time,considering the emission energy and launch angles of the emitted electrons,the phase distribution of the RF field.How angles and reflection coefficients affect the multipactor is also studied.The results show that when a certain tilt dc field is imposed,the smaller the reflection coefficient is,and the longer the delay time of the avalanche breakdown and the greater the number of secondary emission electrons in the steady state are.When the dc field is parallel to the surface of the dielectric plate and the RF field is specified,the higher the electric field amplitude is,the longer the delay time of the avalanche breakdown is and the greater the number of secondary emission electrons in the saturation are,but if the amplitude exceeds a certain value,the multipactor will not occur.When the DC is vertical to the surface of the dielectric plate,the higher the electric field amplitude is,the longer the delay time of the avalanche breakdown is and the smaller the number of the secondary electron in saturation are.Similarly,if the amplitude exceeds a certain value,the multipactor will also not occur.",
