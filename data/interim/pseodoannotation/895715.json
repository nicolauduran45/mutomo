  "title": "Rotative cylinder compressor for energy efficient industrial compression process",
  "abstract": "Gas compression with piston reciprocating compressors dates from 19th century and it is widely used today for a vast range of industrial applications. The process of compression is energetically inefficient as just ten percent of the energy consumed becomes mechanical energy as compressed gas, being the rest of the energy wasted in heating the gas, energy that must be dissipated incurring an additional energy expenditure. ABC COMPRESSORS has developed the Rotating Cylinder Compressor (CCR â€“ Compresor Cilindros Rotativos) which adopts a disruptive concept of piston compression based in centrifugal forces. This new compressor concept enables to reduce up to 20% the energetic consumption of compressors eliminating the need of water cooling and reducing considerably the dimension (and constructive cost) of the compressor.  Oil and Gas market is outlined as principal market for this project due to the big size of the market (around 50% of global compressors), growing trends, and market pressure for reduce energy consumption. More than 10.000 compressors are sold nowadays, and it is expected to have a steadily growth due to natural gas plants proliferation and old compressors replacing market in Europe and US. Taking into account existing needs, potential market, ABC COMPRESSORS` strength and knowledge in high pressure compressors and industrial markets and the possession of patented superior technology (reduction of energy consumption, reduction of price and simplicity), a clear business opportunity for ABC COMPRESSORS is outlined. In this Phase 1 project, a feasibility study will be held to analyse the viability of the whole project, analysing market, product, business and financial features in order to guarantee the profitability of the investment in the identified markets and future scenarios.",
