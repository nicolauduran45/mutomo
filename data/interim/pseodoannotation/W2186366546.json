  "title": "Age-Related Changes in Postural Responses to Backward Platform Translation",
  "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate age-related changes in postural responses to platform translation with 3 various velocities. We focused on the influence of linear velocity using the smoothed profile of platform acceleration (till 100 cm.s−2). Eleven healthy young (20-31 years) and eleven healthy elderly (65-76 years) subjects were examined. The subjects stood on the force platform with their eyes closed. Each trial (lasting for 8 sec) with different velocity (10, 15, 20 cm.s−1) of 20 cm backward platform translation was repeated 4 times. We have recorded displacements of the centre of pressure (CoP) and the EMG activity of gastrocnemius muscle (GS) and tibialis anterior muscle (TA). The results showed increased maximal values of CoP responses to the platform translation. There was also observed a scaling delay of CoP responses to platform translation with different velocities in elderly. The EMG activity of GS muscle during backward platform translation was of about similar shape in both groups during the slowest platform velocity, but it increased depending on rising velocity. EMG activity of TA was not related to the platform velocity. Early parts of postural responses showed significant co-activation of TA and GS muscles of elderly. It is likely that elderly increased body stiffening in order to help their further balance control.",
