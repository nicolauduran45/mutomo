  "title": "EM Scattering From a Target Above a 1-D Randomly Rough Sea Surface Using GPU-Based Parallel FDTD",
  "abstract": "This letter presents the graphics processing unit (GPU)-based finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to investigate the electromagnetic (EM) scattering from a target above a rough sea surface. The proposed method is validated by comparing the numerical results to those obtained through sequential FDTD execution on a central processing unit (CPU), as well as through method of moments (MOM). The comparison results show a significant improvement in computation efficiency for GPU-based FDTD versus the message passing interface (MPI)-based FDTD. Furthermore, our parallel implementation is employed to study the influences of wind speed and the tilt angle of the target on composite scattering from the target above a sea surface.",
