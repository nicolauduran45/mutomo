  "abstract": "The project Planet Design stems from the future and explicit needs of the European Wooden Furnishing sector, which are now recognized at all levels of the production chain. Innovating and differentiating the production offer are today the fundamental leverages for supporting the leadership of the European furnishing production system which, in the light of new changes occurring on the market and legislations environmental issues, must develop an offer which skillfully combines innovation, aesthetics and sustainability. The ability to “devise and manage innovation must become a widespread expertise within company structures, re-designing the NPD processes in a strategic manner. The Planet Design project will offer support to the furnishing production system for achieving this strategic objective, providing an ‘accompaniment’ service that is able to cover those phases of the NPD processes which are managed with greater difficulty by companies internally. Using a systematized approach to innovation does not mean “blocking” companies which quite rightly have distinguished themselves on the domestic and international markets: innovation can never be considered a completely rational and therefore replicable route. However today it is definitely necessary to intervene by integrating those moments of vital “ingenuity” with others of further investigation and rationalization of ideas.",
