  "abstract": "The CORALLO project supports the dissemination and use of the natural heritage through a diverse range of edutainment tools and minor and non-intrusive infrastructure interventions within Natura 2000 (N2K) sites. Through the project, state-of-the-art educational services and facilities will be developed in each of the target sites, including extensive use of virtual and extended reality including documentaries and short video clips. In addition, the iconic species and habitats encountered at each of N2K's target sites will be exhibited in different centers identified for intervention, thus capitalizing on the unique strengths and resources held by each site. The CORALLO project also provides mobile awareness tools, i.e. scientific campaigns for citizens, a boat of project information, smartphone apps and games and online tools, which will allow to reach a wide range of end users. CORALLO wants to achieve a greater degree of awareness of the biodiversity existing within N2K sites and the promotion of related ecosystem services. The project then carries out awareness-raising activities with as many end users as possible.",
