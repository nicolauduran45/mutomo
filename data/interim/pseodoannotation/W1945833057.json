  "abstract": "This article discusses the major ideas of Schumpeter and identifies changes or breaks in his line of thinking throughout his works. His major contribution was to explain the dynamics of economic development based on the emergence of processes of creative destruction that take place under different forms of competition. Many years later this legacy became relevant in developing evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian theory. This article also presents the elements missing from this thinking, later developed by evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian theory. Among them, the importance of learning processes and the development of competition in companies, diffusion mechanisms for innovation and the role of institutions are especially notable.",
