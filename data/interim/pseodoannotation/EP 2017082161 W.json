  "title": "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR TRENCHLESS LAYING OF A CABLE OR PIPE IN THE GROUND",
  "abstract": "The invention proposes a method and devices that can be used in the method for trenchless laying of a cable (1) in the ground (13), in which method vertical multifunction bores (3) are created along a drilling line (4) in the ground (13), via which in the subsequent performance of controlled horizontal drilling (2) the drilling fluid (11) used is drained away and after a protective pipe (12) is drawn into the horizontal bore (2) binding agents (14) are supplied to anchor the protective pipe (12) in the ground (13), followed by drawing the cable (1) into the protective pipe (12) anchored in the ground (13).",
