  "title": "METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING WIND TURBINE TOWER STRUCTURE WITH EMBEDDED REINFORCEMENT ELEMENTS",
  "abstract": "A system for manufacturing a structure includes a supporting frame assembly (104) moveable in a vertical direction of the structure. Further, the system includes an additive printing assembly (118) secured to the supporting frame assembly. The additive printing assembly includes at least one printer head (120,122,130) configured to dispense a first cementitious material. The system also includes a reinforcement dispensing assembly (136) supported by the supporting frame assembly. Thus, the reinforcement dispensing assembly is configured to automatically and continuously dispense a plurality of reinforcing members as the structure is printed and built up via the at least one printer head and as the supporting frame assembly moves in the vertical direction.",
