  "title": "REGELUNG FÜR EIN SIMULIERTES BOHRLOCH ZUM PRÜFEN MIT DYNAMISCHEM UNTERDRUCK",
  "abstract": "Um die Effizienz eines Perforierungswerkzeugsystems zu optimieren, können untertage herrschende Bedingungen simuliert werden, um die optimale Auslegung für das Perforierungswerkzeugsystem zu bestimmen. Ein simuliertes Bohrloch ist in einer simulierten Bohrlochummantelung angeordnet und an eine Formationsprobe gekoppelt. Das simulierte Bohrloch umfasst das Perforierungswerkzeugsystem und eine oder mehrere Füllscheiben, die ein Volumen des simulierten Bohrlochs aufbrauchen. Die Füllscheiben werden verwendet, um den dynamischen Unterdruck für eine jeweilige Simulation eines Perforierungswerkzeugsystems zu regeln. Eine oder mehrere Messungen, die mit dem Perforierungswerkzeugsystem verbunden sind, können zusammen mit einer oder mehreren Aufnahmen generiert werden, nachdem Sprengladungen des Perforierungswerkzeugsystems zum Detonieren gebracht worden sind. Das Perforierungswerkzeugsystem kann zumindest teilweise auf der Grundlage der einen oder mehreren Messungen und der einen oder mehreren Aufnahmen für den spezifischen dynamischen Unterdruck der Simulation modifiziert werden.",
