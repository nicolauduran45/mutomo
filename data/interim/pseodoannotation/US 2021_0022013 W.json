  "abstract": "A fastener (540) is provided that securely couples a first body (568) to a second body (570), where the fastener (540) includes an elongate arcuate body (542) curved along a longitudinal axis and having a cross-sectional area taken planar normal to the longitudinal axis, the elongate arcuate body (542) includes a first portion (548) separated along the longitudinal axis from a second portion (550) with the cross-sectional area of the elongate body increasing from the first portion (548) to the second portion (550). The fastener (540) further includes a retaining portion (556) configured to selectively secure the elongate arcuate body (542) in the inserted configuration. In use, the present fastener is configured to be inserted into an arcuate converging passage (598) delineated between the first body (568) and the second body (570) which are overlapping at least in part, to selectively lock the first body (568) and the second body (570) in the coupled configuration.",
