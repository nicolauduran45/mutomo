  "abstract": "The applicant, within the framework of this project, will implement a complete technological line for the production of a new type of pocket spring formats. The entrepreneur has great experience in developing modern furniture solutions – including pocket spring formats. As part of a previous EU project, it has made one of the most important implementations in this area in the country. Kerson can be considered, in many respects, as a precursor to new solutions and technologies. The project will be implemented in one step. The applicant will purchase a technological sequence – a digital device for the production of spring pocket formats using the unique and innovative country-wide two-head retractor technology with integrated assembly technology – also a digital device. The use of a two-headed solution will allow the Applicant to operate the retractor in parallel with the use of two different input materials – parallel production of a spring size pocket type using two different wires and the possibility of any configuration of the setting of individual springs. This solution is intended to respond to a very important problem at present – namely strengthening the rigidity of the format on its edges with the proper elasticity of the inner surface (it is easiest to illustrate this everyday problem of mattress users – sitting on the edge of the mattress with spring insert we feel discomfort associated with the extinction of the mattress and the loss of its rigidity/shape). The use of two different wires (plus the Applicant’s knowledge of modern solutions and results of previous projects) will allow the Applicant to create a more rigid format on the edges and standard in the rest of the area – the standard in this case means the latest solution available on the market, i.e. a zone insert.",
