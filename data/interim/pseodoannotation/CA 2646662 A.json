  "title": "A QUICK LOCK WIRELINE VALVE/BLOW-OUT PREVENTOR AND METHODS FOR MAKING AND USING SAME",
  "abstract": "A blow out preventor (BOP) apparatus is disclosed that includes a BOP body including a quick connection system including one female connector or a plurality of female connectors, disposed in each actuator receiving aperture, each female connector having a female engaging profile and one male connector or a plurality of male connectors, disposed on an outer surface of an actuator cylinder, one for each female connector, each male connector having a male engaging profile, where the male engaging profile is adapted to register with the female engaging profile upon insertion of an actuator into its corresponding receiving aperture and upon rotation of the actuator through a rotational angle, the male profile engages the female profile in at least one contacting zone, and where the rotational angle depends on the profiles.",
