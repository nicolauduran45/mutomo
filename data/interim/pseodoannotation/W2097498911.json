  "title": "ECCD Experiments Using the Upgraded Launching System in Heliotron J",
  "abstract": "Electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) experiments have been made in Heliotron J by using an upgraded EC launching system. A focused Gaussian beam is injected with the parallel refractive index, N||, ranging from -0.05 to 0.6. Ray tracing calculation shows that the EC power is more localized than that in the previous launching system. In the initial ECCD experiment, the EC injection angle has been successfully scanned as designed. Comparison between perpendicular and oblique launching experiments shows that for standard configuration, the EC current of 1 kA is driven at N� ∼ 0.3 in the Fisch-Boozer direction, and the bootstrap current flows up to 1 kA. A large increase in electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals has been observed when the EC current was driven. c",
