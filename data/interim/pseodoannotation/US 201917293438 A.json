  "title": "Activators And Methods Of Using The Same For Barricading A Door",
  "abstract": "Barricade devices and methods of barricading a door are disclosed. Such devices and methods may be used to barricade a door, and thereby prevent an intruder from entering a sheltering space, such as a classroom, storeroom, or hallway. The barricade-device may have a pivotable stop-device that is pivotable from a location adjacent to a door. The pivot-location may be at an elevation that is lower than a door handle. The stop-device may be pivotable from a reserve-position to a stop-position. In the reserve-position, the stop-device does not barricade the door. In the barricade-position, the stop-device barricades the door. Operation of the barricade-device may require the application of an activation operation to an activator. A wide range of people having differing physical and mental capabilities may use the barricade-device properly and quickly.",
