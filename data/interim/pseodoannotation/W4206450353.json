  "abstract": "Este trabajo presenta un estudio general de los artefactos líticos del sitio Chepu 005, costa occidental de Chiloé, cuya secuencia ocupacional abarca desde el Holoceno Medio en adelante. A partir de nueva información cronológica y el reanálisis de colecciones de museo, se realiza una caracterización morfotécnica inicial de los conjuntos, y se registran variaciones en los sistemas tecnológicos y la gestión de los recursos minerales a lo largo de la secuencia ocupacional, fundamentadas en el abandono de la bifacialidad como estrategia tecnológica predominante, la incorporación de nuevas tecnologías de captura de peces y cambios en los patrones de aprovisionamiento de materias primas líticas.",
