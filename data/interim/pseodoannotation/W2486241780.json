  "title": "Noise Pollution and Its Impact on Human Health and Social Behavior using Systems Approach-A Case Study in Kurnool City",
  "abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the noise pollution problem in the Kurnool city of Andhra Pradesh, India and its effect on the public. Transportation and horn used in vehicle are the major source of noise pollution. Noise is one of the environmental problems that make daily life uncomfortable. It is an unidentified pollution that causes adverse effects on human life. Noise interferes in complex task performance, modifies social behavior and causes annoyance. Six different locations are chosen for study. Noise levels are monitored at different times in the day and night. Bronfenbrenner’s systems approach is used to illustrate the socio behavioral changes in human life due to noise. Keywords : Traffic noise – severe health issues - effect on social behavior - systems approach.",
