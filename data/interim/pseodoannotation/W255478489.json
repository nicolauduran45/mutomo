  "abstract": "Historical Dictionary of Angola. Second Edition. By W. Martin James. Historical Dictionaries of Africa. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2011. Pp. xlii, 347; maps, acronyms and abbreviations, bibliography. $95.00. W. Martin James' second edition of the Historical Dictionary of Angola constitutes a welcomed update to a series that examines one of Africa's most dynamic countries. In fact, this is the fourth installment of this volume; both the original version that Phyllis M. Martin compiled in 1980 and a second edition of that version that Susan H. Broadhead organized in 1992 preceded James' first edition (2004) and this 2010 update. As with each previous version, this latest edition dramatically expands upon its predecessor, featuring significantly more dictionary entries and an expanded Acronyms and Abbreviations section, as well as a more robust (and updated) Chronology and Bibliography. This edition also includes entries that outline the significant events that have transpired in Angola since the last edition, including: the ongoing reconstruction and development of the country following the 2002 conclusion of its protracted civil war; the return and re-integration of copious war refugees; and the ruling MPLA government's consolidation of power. Throughout the many editions of this volume, the Historical Dictionary of Angola has remained an invaluable and unparalleled resource for committed scholars, student researchers and even casual inquirers. As Scarecrow Press celebrates the fortieth anniversary of its Historical Dictionaries, this latest Angolan contribution is indicative of the accessibility, accuracy, and overall utility that has characterized the over- 100 volumes that comprise this long-running series. This edition's well-organized, alphabetically arranged entries are both broader and deeper than those appearing in previous versions. In addition to featuring key historical events, important places, and past and present political and military figures, the volume also contains a number of general headings, including Art, Children's Issues, Religion and Tourism, to name just a few. The Historical Dictionary also features entries for a number of influential authors and journalists, which helps to diversify the overall range of entries. Within each entry, terms that can be found elsewhere in the volume appear in bold, while readers are also directed to any relevant entries that otherwise don't appear in the description. These and other features render the volume highly navigable, even for firsttime users. Given the virtually endless range of potential topics that a volume of this nature might contain, it's inevitable that the Historical Dictionary of Angola features entries that certain readers will question and omissions that will vex others. â€¦",
