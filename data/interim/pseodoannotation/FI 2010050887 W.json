  "abstract": "The invention relates to a process for the production of paper or board comprising: adding a retention system to a stream of stock entering a paper machine head box, directing the stream of stock to a wire, de watering the stream of stock on the wire to form a paper web, and drying the paper web, wherein the retention system comprises a water-soluble cationic polymer, and nanocellulose acting like a micro particle, wherein the nanocellulose is added in an amount of less than 1% as active substance based on dry solids weight of the stock.",
