  "title": "AIRBAG ARRANGEMENT",
  "abstract": "The invention relates to an airbag arrangement for a vehicle passenger restraint system, having an airbag (1) and at least one first and one second inflatable chamber (11, 12) of the airbag, wherein the first chamber (11) has at least one section designed as an exhaust area (112) via which air can escape from the first chamber (11), and wherein the exhaust area (112) is arranged relative to the second chamber (12) in such a way that the exhaust area (112) is pressed together by the action of the interior pressure (P2) of the second chamber (12) if the interior pressure (P2) of the second chamber (12) is higher than the interior pressure (P1) of the first chamber (11), and as a result the exhaust cross section of the exhaust area (112) is reduced.",
