  "title": "TIRE HAVING DECORATIVE SIDEWALL",
  "abstract": "Tires having white sidewalls are very popular in the United States and Canada. Tires having white lettering thereon are also very popular. This invention discloses a process for preparing such tires having decorative appliques thereon. By practicing the process of this invention, tires having better uniformity can be built at lower costs than when standard tire building techniques are utilized. This invention specifically relates to a method of preparing a pneumatic rubber tire having a decorative design on the sidewall thereof which comprises (a) applying the decorative design to the sidewall of an uncured tire and (b) curing the tire; wherein the decorative design is comprised of from about 25 weight percent to about 75 weight percent syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene having a melting point which is within the range of about 100°C to about 160°C and from about 25 weight percent to about 75 weight percent of at least one polydiene rubber which is cocurable with said syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, at least one pigment or colorant, sulfur, and zinc oxide.
