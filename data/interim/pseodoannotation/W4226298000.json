  "title": "“El Araceli” Non-destructive Test from the “Misterio de Elche” Play",
  "abstract": "In the city of Elche, every year, on August 14 and 15, it is celebrated a sacred musical drama of the death, the passage into heaven (known as the Assumption) and the crowning of the Virgin Mary. This event, known as “Misterio de Elche” play is unique in Europe. Since the mid-fifteenth century it has been performed in the Basilica of Saint Mary and in the streets of the old city of Elche, situated in the region of Valencia. The stage has two levels: the horizontal “terrestrial” stage and the vertical “celestial” stage, characteristic of the medieval mystery play. Ancient aerial machinery is used to enhance the spectacle by means of special effects. From the upper level, several aerial devices are raised and lowered in a controlled manner. These devices are called “La Mangrana”, “El Araceli” and “La Santísima Trinidad”. To give context to the reader, it is important to highlight that “El Araceli” is a device prepared to support five people situated in a special layout. The original supporting structure of this apparatus was made up of forged steel, wood and hemp ropes, but with the passage of time, some successive renovations were required. In 2010, wear was detected in some parts by the technical department that could cause security problems. Due to this circumstance, it was ordered a deep study. This paper analyzes a non-destructive test that was carried out on “El Araceli”. A data acquisition system customized to the device was used to verify that the apparatus was suitable for the loads for which it was designed.",
