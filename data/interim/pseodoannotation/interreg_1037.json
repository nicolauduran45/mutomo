  "abstract": "CONTEXT: Policies aiming at supporting SMEs lack some effectiveness and efficiency in the tourism sector in many European regions. With a more favourable environment, SMEs could grow faster and create more jobs. For tourist SMEs, it would require the creation of a management strategy of the territory, i.e. a Destination Management strategy. PARTNERSHIP: The project brings together 7 partners from 7 EU countries (FR, IT, MT, IE, FI, LT, SI) consisting of a mix of public authorities at national, regional and local level and agencies having a delegation of competences from their public authority. When relevant, authorities in charge of targeted policies are committed to provide their entire support. Relevant stakeholders within each area will be strongly involved in the exchange of experience at interregional level and planned adaptation of policy instruments. OBJECTIVE: Improve public policies (through structural funds, national or regional policy instruments) dedicated to the support of tourist SMEs and their competitiveness. APPROACH: Three-steps approach in Phase 1. Interregional exchange of experiences in that field and subsequent introduction into their policies of solutions for a better destination management of the territory (final purpose under Phase 2). MAIN ACTIVITIES AND OUTPUTS: 7 policy instruments are addressed (1 per region), among which 5 relate to structural funds programmes. Basis for exchange of experience: Reciprocal improvement analysis and 7 study trips with peer-review of each partner’s practices. Video newsletters and a movie for an effective dissemination towards other territories in Europe. MAIN EXPECTED RESULTS: At least 14 good practices identified. 7 targeted policy instruments improved. At least 21 staff members will transfer new capacities in their intervention fields. At least 30 involved stakeholders with increased skills and knowledge from exchange of experience. Expected 15 appearances in press and media, including at European level.",
