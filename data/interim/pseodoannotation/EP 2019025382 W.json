  "title": "BURNER MODULE AND METHOD FOR THE ADDITIVE MANUFACTURE OF A BURNER MODULE OF THIS KIND",
  "abstract": "A burner module according to the invention comprises at least three or four or five or six or seven or eight functional walls which delimit at least one first functional space and form a module body, wherein the module body has at least three or four or five or six or six or seven gas passage openings and at least two of these gas passage openings are connected to one another communicatively via the first functional space, and wherein at least one nozzle device having a fuel gas opening is formed in an upper wall of the burner module, which fuel gas opening is connected communicatively to the first functional space via a gas channel. The burner module is produced in an additive manner.",
