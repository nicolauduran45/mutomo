  "title": "REGULATING VALVE",
  "abstract": "Thermomechanical regulating valve comprising a valve housing (4) provided with a first and second fluid inlet (10; 12) and a fluid outlet (14), with a chamber (6) which is connected to the inlets and outlet, in which chamber a valve closing body (8) is displaceably arranged for regulating the connection between the inlets and outlet. For comparing the temperatures of the fluid flows fed to the chamber (6) via the inlets, a temperature sensing adjusting device (16; 18) is inserted in each inlet, with a motion transmitting element (20; 22) articulated to the valve closing body, the movement of which elements, caused by the respective adjusting devices, gives rise to displacement and rotation of the valve closing body in the chamber to a position in contact with a seat, in which position the respective inlet is closed.",
