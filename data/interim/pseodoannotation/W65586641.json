  "title": "Considerations of Sustainability Assessment",
  "abstract": "The main attributes of a sustainable policy are to strengthening social capacity and human development programs without affecting the future ability of developing and availing resources. Policy considerations on socioeconomic development, poverty elevation, natural resource dependence, resource availability, nature of capital, and institutional attributes determine policy sustainability. However, unlike economic contemplations, natural resources and the environment have certain peculiarities that designate complexity of sustainability assessment. The nature of peculiarities maybe different for different components of policies. This chapter discusses on those issues relating their linkages with sustainability and differentiates them as voluntary or involuntary. Relevant diagrammatic flowcharts have also been presented to reveal clarification.",
