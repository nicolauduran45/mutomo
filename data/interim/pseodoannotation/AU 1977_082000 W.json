  "abstract": "Indicating means (G) for a door operator device. Said indicating means (G) being for indicating either or both of a door fully opened and/or fully closed condition, said door operator device having drive means (M) for moving the door to said positions in response to operation of initiating means (X) connected therewith, said operator device having circuit switch means (A and B) to switch off the drive when the door has reached either of said positions, and wherein said indicating means (G) is operatively interconnectable with said door operator device to provide said indication when the door is in the respective fully opened or closed condition.",
