  "title": "OPERATING MECHANISM ENCLOSING THE CORD OF A SCREEN ASSEMBLY",
  "abstract": "An operating mechanism for a screen assembly of the type having an elongate endless pull cord hanging from the screen assembly in a loop, said operating mechanism comprising a housing having an opening at an upper end whereby at least a lower portion of the pull cord can pass into the housing to be enclosed therein, the housing incorporating guide means for guiding passage of the pull cord through the housing, said guide means incorporating locking means adapted to selectively restrain first or second sides of a loop defined by the pull cord such that reciprocating motion of the housing with respect to the screen assembly causes rotation of the operating mechanism of the screen assembly.",
