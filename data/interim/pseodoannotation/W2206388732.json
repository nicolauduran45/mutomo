  "abstract": "Topic: An Investigation of the Rice Price Changes in the Zhu Qian Region in Qing Dynasty from the Yue Don I-min Temple Investiture Offering Ceremony Register This study utilized historical documents as its source materials (account books) and adopted a scientific statistical method to research the local grain prices (rice). This research extracted valid grain price data from the Yue Don I-min Temple Investiture Offering Ceremony Register (the account book of I-min Temple) to set up a valid rice price sequence. Meanwhile, all the data was broken down by time series in order to observe the long-time trends and identify the rice price changes (price changes) in the Zhu Qian Region in Qing Dynasty. The rice / grain prices listed in the Yue Don I-min Temple Investiture Offering Ceremony Register are a part of the data recorded in accordance with the trading results of the rice market in the Zhu Qian Region in Qing Dynasty. Therefore, the rice price changes listed in the account book clearly show the rice price changes in the Zhu Qian Region in Qing Dynasty. After consulting the data in the account book, the study used time series to analyze the data. It can be seen from the long-term trends that the price of rice in this region went up yearly. In fact, at the beginning of the first period of time (1841-1856), in 1841, the lowest price was 69 cents; however, by 1856, the lowest price raised to 85 cents. Furthermore, during the second period of time (1857 – 1884), the rice price had risen rapidly since 1856 and reached the second highest price in 1864 (from 85 cents to 194 cents). However, ever since 1864, the price had gone down sharply from 194 cents to 89 cents in just 4 years. The biggest decrease was in 1866-1867 (from 190 cents to 120 cents). However, the price went up again from 1868 (it reached 199 cents in 1876 from 140, 128 cents). However, the price change in the third period (1885-1893) became more stable after 1885. Aside from that, after comparing with the rice sequences from different sources and accounting for extreme prices and disasters, the rises and falls are fairly similar with the rice sequence set up in accordance with the Yue Don I-min Temple Investiture Offering Ceremony Register. Therefore, it can be concluded that the rice sequence should have a fairly high reliability because of the quality of the available data.",
