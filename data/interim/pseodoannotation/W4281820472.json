  "abstract": "Neste ensaio, procuro pôr em evidência imagens e memórias de alguns moradores de San Félix, pequeno vilarejo localizado na província de Santiago del Estero, ao norte da Argentina. Atualmente, a localidade tem uma população com cerca de 200 habitantes, distribuídos em 45 famílias e se caracteriza por ser o único povoado onde todos, homens e mulheres, são afrodescendentes. Existem muitas lacunas quando se conta a história desse lugarejo. De fato, se contava pouco e se ocultava muito, era parte do processo do branqueamento, cujo discurso era de negação e invisibilidade. Resta como testemunho depoimentos da história oral, um velho registro e as lápides no cemitério. Em 2020, San Félix foi declarado Patrimônio Histórico, Cultural, Educativo e Turístico da Nação, pela UNESCO, após uma longa luta em busca do reconhecimento. Este pequeno ensaio, longe de mostrar a riqueza cultural, procura construir narrativas distintas ao relato hegemônico da identidade euro branca argentina ao tornar visíveis alguns habitantes e sua comunidade.",
