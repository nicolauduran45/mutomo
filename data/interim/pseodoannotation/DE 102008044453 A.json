  "title": "Online-shop operating method for purchasing goods, involves assigning controlling unit to server, which records input entry, output entry and purchasing entry that are accumulated in frame of communication between client computer and server",
  "abstract": "The method involves assigning decision logic (1) to a server. A shopping basket value (A), offering costs (B), acceptance probability (C) and probability for a purchase failure (D) are determined as input parameters, where the decision logic calculates an excepted benefit. A positive excepted benefit is provided to customer. A controlling unit is assigned to the server, which records an input entry, output entry and a purchasing entry that are accumulated in a frame of communication between a client computer and the server.",
